# Summary
Define Step Run

## Scope
actual executions of Steps within Workflow Runs.

## Claim

a Step Run **means** **`=1`** actual execution of **`=1`** Step within **`=1`** Workflow Run, invoking the Step's **`=1`** referenced Action with the bound parameters **and** inputs for that run.

- separate executions of the same Step are distinct Step Runs; they reuse the Step **and** Action definitions.
- an Agentic Step Run records its resolved invocation context under CA-R-1527-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--define-agentic-step-execution-context. its internal Tool-call evidence is associated with this Run under CA-R-1528-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--record-tool-calls-within-step-runs; a Tool call **or** repeated delivery of a pending invocation does **not** itself create another Step Run.
- the Step Run is distinct from its definition **and** from its Journal Records. a recorded attempt **or** failure **must not** be represented as successful completion.
