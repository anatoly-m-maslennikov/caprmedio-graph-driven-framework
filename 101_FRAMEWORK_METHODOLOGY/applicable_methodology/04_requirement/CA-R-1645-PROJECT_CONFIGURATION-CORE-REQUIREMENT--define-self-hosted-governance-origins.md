# Summary

Define self-hosted Governance origins

## Scope

Governance Origin for the self-hosted caprmedio Project and its distributed CAPRMEDIO sources.

## Claim

Governance Origin for the self-hosted caprmedio Project **and** its distributed CAPRMEDIO sources follows the ownership distinction **in** CA-R-1709-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-two-governance-origins:

- within the caprmedio Project, its Project-owned Methodology authority, framework authority, **and** other Project-owned Artifacts have internal Governance Origin.
- a distributed CAPRMEDIO framework source has external Governance Origin relative **to** a consuming Project. that Project's own adaptation authority has internal Governance Origin; creating it does **not** transfer ownership of the external source **or** change that source's origin.
- graph Relations, version-control authorship, filesystem ownership, **and** byte identity do **not** replace the governing ownership distinction.
