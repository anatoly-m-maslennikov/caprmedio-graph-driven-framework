# Summary

Define production log severity meanings

## Scope

Logging Policies for production-relevant components.

## Claim

a Logging Policy **must** use these four operational levels:

| Level | Required meaning |
|---|---|
| `ERROR` | an operation failed, correctness **or** availability **may** be affected, **or** explicit retry **or** intervention is required |
| `WARNING` | behavior was unexpected **or** degraded but recovered, fell back, **or** remains within an accepted tolerance |
| `INFO` | a material lifecycle, business, **or** operational milestone occurred, including start, stop, acceptance, state transition, completion, **or** summarized progress |
| `DEBUG` | sanitized internal state **or** decision detail is useful for bounded investigation but is unnecessary during normal production operation |

## Details

the four level meanings are one taxonomy **and** retain one lifecycle as a set.
