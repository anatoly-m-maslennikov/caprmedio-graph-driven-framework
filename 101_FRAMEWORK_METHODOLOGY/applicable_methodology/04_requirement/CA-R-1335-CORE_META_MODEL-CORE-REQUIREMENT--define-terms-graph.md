# Summary

Define Terms Graph

## Scope

Terms Graph projections **and** their represented graph facts.

## Claim

Terms Graph **means** the Type value under Projection whose instances are derived CAPRMEDIO Graphs with native Term nodes **and** edges representing Relations admitted for that graph kind by their governing authority. their represented facts retain their appropriate source authority under CA-R-1746.

## Details

admitted external graph **or** source references under CA-R-1472 do **not** become native Term nodes merely by being referenced. those references retain their own endpoint classes **and** graph-qualified Relation authority.
