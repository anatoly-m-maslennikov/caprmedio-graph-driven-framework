# Summary

Define Source-declared Relation Derivation

## Scope

source-declared derivation of represented Realization Graph Relations.

## Claim

Source-declared Relation Derivation **means** that a represented Realization Graph Relation is explicitly encoded **in** an identified selected native source, manifest, **or** configuration.

## Details

the result **must** identify the exact source occurrence **and** the interpretation used **to** read that declaration. declaring a Relation does **not** establish that it executes, resolves successfully, **or** satisfies a Requirement.
