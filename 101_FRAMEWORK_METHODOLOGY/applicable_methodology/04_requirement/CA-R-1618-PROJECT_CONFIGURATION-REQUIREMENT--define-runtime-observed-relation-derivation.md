# Summary

Define Runtime-observed Relation Derivation

## Scope

runtime-observed derivation of represented Realization Graph Relations.

## Claim

Runtime-observed Relation Derivation **means** that a represented Realization Graph Relation is supported by recoverable evidence of its occurrence during an identified execution.

## Details

the result **must** identify the execution, relevant inputs **and** state, observation boundary, **and** supporting record. observation **in** that execution does **not** prove occurrence **in** unobserved executions, the absence of unobserved Relations, **or** compliance with a Requirement.
