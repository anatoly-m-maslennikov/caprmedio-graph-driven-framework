# Summary

Separate legacy observations from refactoring decisions

## Scope

Reverse-engineering results, including observed Implementation facts and proposed decisions about the intended refactored result.

## Claim

reverse-engineering results **must** distinguish observed Implementation facts from proposed decisions about the intended refactored result.

- behavior **or** constraints proposed for preservation **must** be identified as proposed decisions.
- behavior **or** constraints proposed for change **must** be identified as proposed decisions.
- unresolved behavior, missing evidence, **and** uncertain interpretations **must** remain explicit.

an observed behavior **or** defect **must not** become a Requirement merely because it exists **in** the legacy Implementation. supporting evidence **must** remain recoverable **without** a proposed disposition **or** uncertainty being presented as an observed fact.
