# Summary

Keep secondary graphs derived from source authority

## Scope

secondary CAPRMEDIO Graphs.

## Claim

secondary CAPRMEDIO Graphs **must** be Projections derived from their selected authoritative sources **or** source-traceable upstream Projections. their nodes **and** Relations **must** preserve source identities **and** traceability **to** the governing derivation authority **and** source facts.

storing, composing, filtering, **or** rebuilding a secondary graph **must not** make its contents another source of authority. a represented source fact is corrected **at** its authoritative source; an incorrect derivation is corrected under its governing methodology. neither case is resolved by independently editing the projected fact **or** fabricating source history.
