# Summary

Define Action

## Scope

the definition of an Action.

## Claim

an Action **means** an Atom with Content Role Operations **and** Type Action whose Claim specifies one reusable operational building block with an explicit operational contribution **and** a justified boundary at the modeled responsibility **and** granularity **where** further division has no useful independently governed meaning. this atomic boundary is **not** a count of machine instructions **or** Tool calls; an arbitrary large procedure **without** that justified boundary is **not** an Action. the Action is distinct from an Actor, a Tool, a Task, a particular execution, a Journal Record, **and** a Carrier. its execution kind is defined under CA-R-1526; an Agentic Action **may** use Tools **without** making **every** call another Action **or** Step.
