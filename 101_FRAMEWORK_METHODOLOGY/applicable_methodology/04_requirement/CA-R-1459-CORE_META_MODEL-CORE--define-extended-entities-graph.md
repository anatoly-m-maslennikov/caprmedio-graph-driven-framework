# Summary

Define Extended Entities Graph

## Scope

the Extended Entities Graph Projection Type.

## Claim

Extended Entities Graph **means** the Type value under Projection whose instances compose an Entities Graph Projection with representations of the Atoms that govern **or** depend on its represented Entities, using the source Atoms' direct Subjects references **and** canonical identities.

the composite view derives its Atom links **and** Entity structure from their authoritative sources **or** source-traceable upstream Projections. represented Atoms, Entities, **and** Relation facts retain their existing identities **and** source authority; repeated participation does **not** create another Atom, Entity, **or** independently authored Relation fact. the composite Projection Type does **not** become another owner of the represented graph-specific Relation Kinds. this admission establishes the composite Projection's classification **and** source-authority boundary; direct Atom-link mechanics **and** composed navigation remain governed by their corresponding authority.
