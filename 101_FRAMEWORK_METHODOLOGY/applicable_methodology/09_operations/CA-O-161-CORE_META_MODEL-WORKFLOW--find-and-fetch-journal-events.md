# Summary

Find and fetch Journal Events

## Operation

Find and Fetch Journal Events **must** execute one read-only query Step, CA-O-163, against the selected Project's canonical Events Journal and return only the source snapshot selected before its actual execution records can be appended.

### Steps

| Workflow-owned Step |
|---|
| CA-O-163 |

### Transitions

| Step | Result condition | Next Step or outcome |
|---|---|---|
| CA-O-163 | valid query completed with truthful coverage | complete |
| CA-O-163 | invalid filter, malformed Event, missing ID, duplicate field, incomplete read, source change, or pagination limit | stop and return the exact diagnostic; no silent skipping or completion claim |

## Details

The workflow adapter captures the Journal byte-prefix before workflow/action-start
recording and Action dispatch. Its Action consumes exactly that sealed frontier,
so its own later Run/Event evidence cannot enter a result.

This Workflow has no mutation Step, alternative log, implicit fetch, or filename-derived identity. Its actual invocation uses the shared selected-Run support governed by CA-D-527, CA-D-528, and CA-D-529; preview creates no Run and execution records are evidence of actual execution only.
