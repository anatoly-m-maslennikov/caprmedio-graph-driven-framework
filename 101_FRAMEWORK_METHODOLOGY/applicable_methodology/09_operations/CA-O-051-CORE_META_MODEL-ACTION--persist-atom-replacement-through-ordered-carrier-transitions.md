# Summary

Persist Atom replacement through ordered Carrier transitions

## Operation

Persist Atom Replacement **means** the reusable Action that persists **`=1`** accepted Atom replacement through its successor activation **and** predecessor archival under CA-R-1432 **and** CA-R-807. its boundary is this replacement transition; it does **not** select **or** authorize the replacement. the execution **must** perform **all** of:

1. persist the successor as Active **before** archiving the predecessor.
2. archive the predecessor as one whole Carrier under CA-D-303 **and** record the corresponding replacement **in** the authoritative Journal with explicit predecessor **and** successor Atom IDs under CA-R-807.
3. retain the predecessor's exact prior Revision bytes as history, including its prior Version, Status **and** Updated At, **without** another metadata edit to them. preserve the current predecessor's body, Summary, identity **and** every frontmatter value except Version, lifecycle `status` **and** `updated_at`; increment Version by exactly **`1`**, serialize `status: Archived` **and** refresh `updated_at` to the actual archive time. change its basename **only** by adding the canonical `@<version>` Archive suffix for that resulting Version under CA-D-289.
4. keep replacement history out of predecessor **and** successor Atom frontmatter; formal replacement relations **and** inverse navigation remain deferred under CA-R-807.
