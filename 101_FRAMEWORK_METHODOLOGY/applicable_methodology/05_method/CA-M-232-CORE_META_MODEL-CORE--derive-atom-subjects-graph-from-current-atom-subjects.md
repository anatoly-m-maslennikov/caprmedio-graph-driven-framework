# Summary

Derive Atom Subjects Graph from Current Atom Subjects

## Scope

Atom Subjects Graph derivation from current Atom Subjects.

## Claim

**to** derive an Atom Subjects Graph, the Generator **must** reproduce **every** selected Subject as a direct GOVERNS **or** DEPENDS_ON graph link from its source Atom **to** its target with its exact canonical target, Subject Path, **and** Relation Kind **without** adding authority, requiring a duplicate target-kind field **in** the Atom's Subjects, **or** creating a separately identified Subject object. a Projection **may** derive a target's kind from its canonical authority **when** the Projection's own Spec calls for that classification; it **must not** independently reauthor that kind **or** require it as duplicated source Subjects metadata. an unmigrated temporal Carrier admitted temporarily by CA-D-269 retains its source classification as migration evidence **without** changing the direct reference **or** requiring that classification **in** the canonical flat representation.
