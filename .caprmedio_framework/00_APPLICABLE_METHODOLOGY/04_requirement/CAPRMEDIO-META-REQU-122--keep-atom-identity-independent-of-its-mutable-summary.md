# Keep Atom identity independent of its mutable summary

An Atom's filename Summary is mutable Carrier metadata and is not part of its stable identity. A draft MAY change its Summary while it has no assigned Atom ID. An accepted role-classified Atom MAY change its Summary through a governed Revision while preserving the exact assigned Atom-ID segment in its Carrier filename.

Every committed Revision remains immutable and recoverable through governed history. A Summary change that still describes the same role-specific atomic unit updates the Carrier filename and H1 without creating a successor Atom.

A change to the primary atomic meaning, rather than a filename or Summary change by itself, requires a successor Atom and a new Atom ID.
