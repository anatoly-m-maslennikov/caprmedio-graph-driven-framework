# Requirement — Use nouns for Content-role names

Every canonical CAPRMEDIO Content-role name is a noun naming the primary kind of contribution represented by that role. A role name MUST NOT be a verb, imperative, workflow instruction, status, or activity label.

The canonical labels are Concern, Analysis, Plan, Requirement, Method, Evaluation, Delivery, Implementation, and Ops. Grammatical variants such as `planning`, `implementing`, or `operating` MAY appear in explanatory prose but MUST NOT replace the canonical role names in identifiers, schemas, settings, folder names, diagrams, or public expansions of CAPRMEDIO.

Any future role proposal MUST supply a noun that remains semantically stable when the workflow, actor, tool, or implementation mechanism changes.

## Primary claim

CAPRMEDIO Content-role names are nouns that classify contributions rather than verbs that prescribe activities.
