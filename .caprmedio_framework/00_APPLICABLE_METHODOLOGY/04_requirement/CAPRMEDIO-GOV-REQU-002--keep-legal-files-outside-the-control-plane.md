# Keep legal files outside the control plane

The repository license remains the root `LICENSE` carrier. Retained third-party licenses and no-license notices live in the root `LICENSES` directory.

These legal carriers are distribution inputs, not CAPRMEDIO methodology, applied artifacts, settings, runtime state, or historical CAPRMEDIO data. They therefore do not live inside `.caprmedio` and are not visible to skill discovery or semantic compilation.

Source provenance stores each legal carrier's globally unique filename. Provenance validation resolves that filename only within `LICENSES`; it does not perform a repository-wide search or treat the legal file as CAPRMEDIO authority.
