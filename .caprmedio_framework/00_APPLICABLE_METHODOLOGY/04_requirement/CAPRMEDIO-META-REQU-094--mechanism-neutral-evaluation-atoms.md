# Requirement — Keep Evaluation Atoms mechanism-neutral and chains distinct

A mechanism-neutral Evaluation Atom defines what claim is checked, the applicable conditions, the acceptance criteria, **and** the disposition rule. It does **not** prescribe whether the check is realized by an automated test, model-judged evaluation, statistical assessment, rubric, manual review, **or** another implementation mechanism.

One Evaluation Atom **may** be realized by multiple distinct evaluation implementations. One implementation **may** realize multiple Evaluation Atoms **only** **when** its result remains attributable to **every** covered claim. Coverage is many-to-many but never implicit.

Deterministic Test implementations **and** qualitative, probabilistic, statistical, rubric-based, **or** model-judged Evaluation implementations retain distinct chains. **every** chain keeps its executable Implementation, configuration **or** rubric, factual Ops result, Evidence, **and** Verification judgment distinguishable. A shared runner, prompt, judge, report, **or** gate does **not** merge their meanings, results, **or** coverage.

Test **and** Evaluation describe implementation mechanisms, **not** Evaluation Types. The Evaluation Atom remains the authority; executable mechanisms are Implementation, **and** their enacted results are Ops.

## Primary claim

Evaluation Atoms remain mechanism-neutral authority, while Test **and** Evaluation implementations **and** their factual Ops results remain distinct, attributable chains.
