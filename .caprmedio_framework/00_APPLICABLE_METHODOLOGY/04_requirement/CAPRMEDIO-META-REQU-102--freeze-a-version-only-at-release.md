# Requirement — Freeze a version only at release

A target version remains mutable until its configured release event succeeds. The event MAY be, for example, acceptance of a release pull request into the main branch, but each project declares its exact boundary.

Release creates one factual Ops Atom called the Release Record, whose primary claim is that the identified version was released with an exact manifest. The manifest binds the normative Atom revisions, realized implementation and delivery revisions, applicable evaluation and evidence, release identifier, and canonical Git commit or tag.

SEMANTICS owns the Release Record's freeze semantics. GOVERNANCE owns its concrete Type registration and carrier rules.

Planning allocation, implementation completion, pull-request creation, or release-candidate naming does not freeze the version before that event.

## Primary claim

A version freezes only when its configured release event creates an immutable, revision-bound Release Record with the Ops Content role and exact released manifest.
