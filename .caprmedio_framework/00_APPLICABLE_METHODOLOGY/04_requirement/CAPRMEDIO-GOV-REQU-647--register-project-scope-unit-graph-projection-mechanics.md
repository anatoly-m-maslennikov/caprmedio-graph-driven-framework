# Register Project Scope Unit Graph Projection mechanics

GOVERNANCE MUST register deterministic generation of `.caprmedio/project_scope_unit_graph.projection.toml` and `.caprmedio/project_scope_unit_graph_sources.projection.toml` from the exact current Project Configuration Atom revision, admitted graph Atom contributions, current graph structure, and applicable Journal inputs. Generation MUST preserve exact per-value source bindings and reject missing, ambiguous, stale, contradictory, malformed, or incompletely mapped sources. The generation procedure is provenance only and never grants either Projection authority.
