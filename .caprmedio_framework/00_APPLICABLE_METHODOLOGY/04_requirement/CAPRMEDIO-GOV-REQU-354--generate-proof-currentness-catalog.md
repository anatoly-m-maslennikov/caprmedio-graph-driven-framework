# Generate the proof currentness Catalog

CAPRMEDIO generates a non-authoritative proof-currentness Catalog from governed proof dependency frontiers encoded under GOV REQU 010 **and** their additional invalidation conditions. The Catalog reports **every** proof as `current`, `stale`, **or** `unknown`, marks **only** the smallest direct **and** transitive dependency closure affected by a change, never infers currentness from timestamps alone, **and** never mutates the historical proof record.
