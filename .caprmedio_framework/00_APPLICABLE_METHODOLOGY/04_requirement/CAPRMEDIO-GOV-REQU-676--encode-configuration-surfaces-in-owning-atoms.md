# Encode configuration surfaces in owning Atoms

GOVERNANCE MAY encode an owning Atom's optional machine-readable contribution to the generated Project Scope Unit Graph under one top-level `project_scope_unit_graph` or `project_graph_state` YAML map only when it faithfully represents that Atom's own governed claim. It MAY declare registered facts, allowed values, defaults, or structural contributions, but MUST NOT encode current operator-selected configuration values or a `project_settings` contribution; current selections belong only to the Project Configuration Atom.
