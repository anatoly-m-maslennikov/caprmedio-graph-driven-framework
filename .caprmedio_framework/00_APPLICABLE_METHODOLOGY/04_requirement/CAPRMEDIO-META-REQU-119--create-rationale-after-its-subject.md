# Requirement — Create Rationale after its subject

A Rationale is an Analysis Atom created **only** **after** **every** specification Atom it explains already exists. The Rationale stores the directed relation to its subjects; specification Atoms contain **none** of (embedded Rationale, persisted Rationale backlink).

Rationale is explanatory rather than normative. Changing an obligation, boundary, Method, Evaluation condition, Delivery rule, **or** acceptance meaning requires a new applicable specification Atom rather than a Rationale.

## Primary claim

A Rationale follows **and** points to its pre-existing specification subjects **without** modifying them.
