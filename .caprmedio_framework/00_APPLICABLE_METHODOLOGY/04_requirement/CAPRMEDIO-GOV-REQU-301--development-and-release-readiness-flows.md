# Separate development and release-readiness flows

development is the default flow:

```text
active atomic authority
→ QA Cases
→ Implementation, including executable Tests and Evaluations
→ factual Ops records
→ development Verification
```

development consumes active atomic authority plus **any** enabled current Projections. it does **not** require **every** enabled Projection to refresh **after** **every** new Atom **unless** that Projection's own gate requires currentness.

release readiness is mandatory **before** a Version can be declared ready:

```text
all active atomic authority
→ optional atomic refactoring when overlap warrants it
→ refresh every required Projection
→ detect conflicts
→ resolve conflicts through new atomic authority
→ repeat to a fixed point
→ reconcile implementation and evaluation
→ execute Tests and Evaluations at the exact candidate head
→ fresh Ops records and Verification
→ accepted readiness Verification Record
```

conflict resolution never edits an accepted Atom. **any** applicable code, configuration, Test, Evaluation, **or** Projection change **after** an Evaluation run makes the affected release evidence stale.

the Framework Instance Settings Artifact records `development` as the default workflow selection **and** `release_readiness` as the mandatory pre-release mode. the Project Scope Unit Graph Projections **may** expose the effective mode but **must not** select it.

## Rationale

the successor removes retired compilation **and** Evergreen terminology while preserving the different currentness needs of ordinary development **and** release.
