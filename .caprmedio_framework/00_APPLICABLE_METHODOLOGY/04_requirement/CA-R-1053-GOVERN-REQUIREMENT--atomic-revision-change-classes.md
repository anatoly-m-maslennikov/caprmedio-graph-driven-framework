# Classify every Atomic Artifact change

Before changing an admitted Atomic Artifact, CAPRMEDIO assigns exactly one change class:

| Change class | Boundary | Identity result | Required review |
|---|---|---|---|
| `carrier_only` | Representation, summary, filename, path, or encoding changes without changing governed meaning | Keep the artifact ID | Verify lossless recoding |
| `refinement` | Wording or criteria become clearer or stricter while primary claim, applicability, and acceptance meaning remain equivalent | Keep the artifact ID and commit a new revision | Demonstrate equivalence and assess lineage |
| `semantic_revision` | Meaning or applicability changes while the same primary claim remains recognizable | Keep the artifact ID and commit a new revision | Declare the delta and complete lineage-impact review |
| `replacement` | The primary claim changes identity, or an independently replaceable claim is added or removed | Create a new artifact ID; record explicit predecessor and successor IDs in the predecessor's archival Journal event | Review the replacement boundary and affected lineage |

Scope narrowing or expansion is a `semantic_revision`, not a carrier-only change. Splitting or combining independently replaceable claims is a `replacement`.

The semantic change class is independent of the Git change set. Every persisted carrier change follows the canonical direct typed-relation commit-message rule. A same-ID content change creates a new Revision, while a carrier-only move or rename MAY preserve the current version. A replacement first commits the successor as active, then archives the predecessor in a `MOVE` whose authoritative Work Journal event records explicit predecessor and successor Atom IDs. Neither Atom's frontmatter authors replacement history. Formal replacement relations and inverse navigation are deferred. The archival move preserves the predecessor's content, filename, frontmatter, and version. Each successor and predecessor carrier change remains a separate one-file commit.

Tools MAY propose a class but MUST fail closed when the distinction between refinement, semantic revision, and replacement is uncertain.

## Rationale

The four classes preserve stable identities for genuine claim evolution while preventing formatting changes, refinements, semantic changes, and replacements from being treated as interchangeable.
