# Register the Implementation Record Projection

GOVERNANCE registers `implementation_record` with prefix `irec` as an internal Implementation-role Projection Type. It presents the current realization, coverage, source-to-target bindings, relevant provenance, and unresolved gaps derived from its declared source frontier.

The Projection declares the exact normative Atom, native-target, provenance, and any registered implementation-lineage frontier it represents. Regeneration replaces its rendered content without converting it into an Atom or granting it authority over the native project, normative specification, Ops evidence, or Verification.

Its storage and retention policy is configured separately. A generated runtime copy MAY be disposable; a committed current view MAY be reviewable history. Neither storage choice changes the Projection's semantic role.

## Rationale

The predecessor incorrectly bundled Change Plan and Implementation Record under one Implementation-role Projection rule. The split preserves the record while routing Change Plan to the new Plan Atom family.
