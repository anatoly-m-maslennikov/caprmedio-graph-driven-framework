# Requirement — Exclude secrets from DSET

DSET never stores, transmits, summarizes, **or** reproduces secret values. Secrets include passwords, API keys, access **or** refresh tokens, session cookies, private keys, signing **or** encryption keys, authentication certificates, one-time **or** recovery codes, **and** connection strings **or** URLs containing credentials.

The prohibition covers atomic **and** evergreen artifacts, settings, generated files, runtime traces, logs, prompts, checkpoints, Evaluation inputs **and** results, Test fixtures **and** snapshots, evidence, support bundles, issues, pull requests, commits, **and** release records. A secret **must** be redacted **before** **any** such surface enters DSET; encoding **or** encrypting a value does **not** make it ordinary DSET data.

For local development, secret values **may** be injected from a repository-local `.env` file outside `.caprmedio`. **every** real `.env` variant is ignored by Git **and** is excluded from DSET discovery. A tracked `.env.example` **may** contain variable names **and** unmistakable dummy placeholders **only**. Production **and** shared automation use the host's secret injection **or** a dedicated secret manager, **not** a committed file **or** DSET setting.

Email addresses, usernames, **and** account identifiers are identifiers rather than authenticators. They **may** appear **in** DSET **when** necessary **and** authorized, but **must** be minimized **and** treated as potentially personal data. **when** an identifier is mutable runtime configuration, its runtime value is supplied through the local environment carrier as well; DSET does **not** become the runtime owner merely because a human-readable artifact names it.

**if** a secret reaches **any** durable **or** shared surface, stop propagation, revoke **or** rotate it immediately, **then** clean affected carriers **and** record the incident **without** reproducing the value. Deleting a current file is **not** sufficient remediation for a value already present **in** Git history **or** another replica.
