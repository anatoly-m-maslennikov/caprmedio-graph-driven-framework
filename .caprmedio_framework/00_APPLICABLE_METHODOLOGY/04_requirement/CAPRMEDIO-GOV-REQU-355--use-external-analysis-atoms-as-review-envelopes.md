# Use external Analysis Atoms as review envelopes

GOVERNANCE imports an external review as an `external_analysis_report` Atom whose governed envelope identifies its source, provenance, reviewed scope, original body, **and** native attachments **without** requiring a provider-specific finding schema. One internal Analysis derives from that Atom, records the project's finding-level interpretation **and** dispositions, **and** becomes the **only** Analysis source from which project-owned Concern, Plan, Requirement, Method, Evaluation, **or** Delivery Atoms are derived. **every** accepted disposition that changes project meaning **or** work is materialized **in** its owning CPRMAD Content role; rejected **or** non-actionable findings remain **only** **in** the internal Analysis.
