# Encode Subjects in Frontmatter

Every active or draft Markdown Atom carrier MUST encode its Subjects under subjects.claim_role.temporal_form as non-empty YAML block sequences of distinct Subject references, MUST encode exactly one value in each present declared temporal-form sequence, MUST use only lowercase keys declared, prerequisite, continuant, and occurrent, MUST omit every empty branch, and MUST encode each Subject reference as either an exact canonical governed-entity reference or a lowercase kebab-case term.
