# Validate CCE Claims and derived Projections

## Claim checked

each active or draft Atom contains one human-readable precise CCE Claim and source-faithful derived Projections.

## Test case

create valid Requirement, Method, and Evaluation Claims. derive Summary, filename slug, H1, Translation, and terminology twice. then introduce ambiguity, an unstated participant, two independent Claims, an added Projection meaning, an independent vocabulary entry, an invalid lexical-case token, and a confidence result below 98 percent.

## Acceptance criteria

every valid fixture has one precise interpretation, valid lexical case, and reproducible Projections. every invalid fixture fails. a confidence result below 98 percent leaves the Atom unchanged and requests Operator disposition.

## Failure disposition

record a Concern naming the affected Claim or Projection.
