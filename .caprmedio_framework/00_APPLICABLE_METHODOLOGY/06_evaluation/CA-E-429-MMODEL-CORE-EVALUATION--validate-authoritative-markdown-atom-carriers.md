# Validate Authoritative Markdown Atom Carriers

the Evaluation **must** reject an Atom Revision **if** it has other than **`=1`** authoritative Markdown Atom Carrier on the Project filesystem, its authoritative Carrier does not contain YAML Frontmatter followed by Main Content, **or** a TOML, YAML, JSON, database, **or** projected copy is treated as authoritative for that Atom Revision.
