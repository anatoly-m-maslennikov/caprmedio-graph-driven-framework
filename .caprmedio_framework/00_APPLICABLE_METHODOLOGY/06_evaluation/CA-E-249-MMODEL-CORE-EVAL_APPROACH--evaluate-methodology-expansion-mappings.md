# Evaluate methodology expansion mappings

a methodology expansion mapping Evaluation **must** return `fail` **if** a source element, exact canonical target, mapping rule, intended Scope, **or** applicable Core distinction is missing, canonical ownership is ambiguous, preservation is unproven, **or** the mapping redefines, replaces, shadows, weakens, deletes, contradicts, **or** reinterprets applicable Core authority; it **must** return `pass` **only** **when** the declared mapping preserves that authority **and** stays within its permitted expansion boundary. an Operator-approved loss **must not** count as conformance; report the failed boundary **and** leave the affected application stopped.
