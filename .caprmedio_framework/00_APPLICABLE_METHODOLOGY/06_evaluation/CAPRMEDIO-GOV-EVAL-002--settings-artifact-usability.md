# Settings Artifact Usability

## Claim checked

an Operator unfamiliar with the repository can configure framework-instance behavior through Framework Instance Settings **and** Project identity, Atom prefix, **and** Authority Modes through Project Settings using **only** the two Settings Artifacts **and** their in-file documentation, while recognizing the Project Scope Unit Graph as a read-only derived view.

## Applicable conditions

the Operator has no undocumented Framework knowledge **and** **must not** edit the Framework Catalog.

## Acceptance criteria

**every** intended change is made through the owning Settings Artifact, **and** **`>=90`**% of classifications correctly distinguish project choices from methodology definitions.

## Failure disposition

record a Concern for **every** misleading **or** missing setting instruction **and** stop settings-usability readiness **until** it is corrected.
