# Validate Relational Atom Classifications

## Claim checked

**every** Relational Atom **must** have **`=1`** qualified Type allowed by the Applicable Methodology, **and** the Core contribution **must** admit **only** Requirement/Goal, Requirement/Demand, **and** Plan/Objective.

## Test case

create one relational Requirement/Goal Atom, one relational Requirement/Demand Atom, **and** one relational Plan/Objective Atom. **then** create relational Atoms with Requirement/Task, Plan/Task, Method, Evaluation, Delivery, Implementation, **and** Ops qualified Types **without** an additional Applicable Methodology contribution.

## Acceptance criteria

**only** the Requirement/Goal, Requirement/Demand, **and** Plan/Objective fixtures pass.

## Failure disposition

record a Concern naming the invalid Relational Atom qualified Type.
