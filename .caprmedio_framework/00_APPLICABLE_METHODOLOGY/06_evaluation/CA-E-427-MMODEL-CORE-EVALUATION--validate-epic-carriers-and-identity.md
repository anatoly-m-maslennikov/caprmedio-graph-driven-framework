# Validate Epic Carriers and Identity

## Claim checked

**every** Epic **must** be a Structural Entity with **`=1`** Directory Carrier, **`=1`** canonical Epic Identifier, **`=1`** canonical Directory Carrier name, **`=1`** Status allowed by its Epic Status domain, Status-qualified placement, **and** identity independent from member changes.

## Test case

create one valid Epic Revision for **every** allowed Epic Status; place the Active revision **in** its canonical current directory **and** place **every** other revision **in** its Status subdirectory; use canonical identifiers **and** Directory Carrier names; preserve Archived **only** for a prior revision **or** the final revision of a replaced, absorbed, **or** retired Epic; **and** add, remove, reorder, **and** change members **without** changing Epic identity. **then** create an Epic with **`!=1`** Directory Carriers, use malformed identifiers **or** names, use a Status outside its resolved domain, place a non-Active Epic outside its Status subdirectory, place an Active Epic inside a Status subdirectory, assign Archived to a current unreplaced Epic revision, **and** change Epic identity **after** a member change.

## Acceptance criteria

**all** valid fixtures preserve one Epic identity **and** pass. **all** invalid fixtures fail.

## Failure disposition

record a Concern naming the invalid Epic Carrier, Identifier, Status, placement, **or** identity fact.
