# Storage-boundary interpretability

## Claim checked

An operator can place an Atom, Journal record, resumable checkpoint, generated cache, **and** disposable workspace **in** the governed storage boundary **and** explain its retention behavior.

## Applicable conditions

The available boundaries are `.caprmedio`, `.caprmedio_runtime`, **and** the host temporary root. Governed Journals are located inside `.caprmedio` by scope **and** Content role.

## Acceptance criteria

**`>=90`**% of classifications are correct **and** no classification treats runtime **or** scratch as canonical truth.

## Failure disposition

Record a Concern for **every** ambiguous boundary **and** stop storage-boundary readiness **until** the governing rule **or** its presentation is corrected.
