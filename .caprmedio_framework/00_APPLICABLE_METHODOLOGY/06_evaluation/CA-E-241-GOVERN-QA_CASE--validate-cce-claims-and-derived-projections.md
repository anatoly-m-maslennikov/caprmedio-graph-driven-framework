# Validate CCE Claims and derived Projections

## Claim checked

**every** active **or** draft Atom **contains** one human-readable precise CCE Claim **and** source-faithful derived Summary **and** Translations.

## Test case

create valid Requirement, Method, **and** Evaluation Claims. derive Summary, Translation, **and** terminology twice. **then** introduce ambiguity, an unstated participant, two independent Claims, an added Projection meaning, an independent vocabulary entry, **and** a confidence result below 98 percent.

## Acceptance criteria

**every** valid fixture has one precise interpretation **and** reproducible Projections. **every** invalid fixture fails. a confidence result below 98 percent leaves the Atom unchanged **and** requests Operator disposition.

## Failure disposition

record a Concern naming the affected Claim **or** Projection.
