# Effective-priority selection

## Claim checked

Conflict selection derives the governed effective priorities and never chooses through a tie, incomparable scope, uncertainty, or ineligible external obligation.

## Applicable conditions

1. Accept stored priority only on Concern Atoms and reject it on Epic, Task, Action Policy, and every other Content role Atom.
2. Accept only stored `high`, `medium`, or `low`.
3. Reject stored `highest`, `critical`, and `deferred`.
4. Apply the strict-ancestor and earlier-layer increments independently and together, capped at virtual `highest`.
5. Confirm `ask_always` always asks.
6. Confirm `auto_by_effective_priority` selects exactly one unique eligible winner and asks on ties, incomparable scopes, uncertainty, or multiple winners.
7. Confirm unsatisfiable external obligations stop rather than auto-resolve.

## Acceptance criteria

Every comparison produces the governed effective priorities and never guesses through a non-unique or ineligible result.

## Failure disposition

Stop automatic selection, ask the operator, and record a Concern for any incorrect priority or unauthorized winner.
