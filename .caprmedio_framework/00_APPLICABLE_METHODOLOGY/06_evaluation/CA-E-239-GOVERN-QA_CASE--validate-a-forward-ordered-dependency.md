# Validate a Forward Ordered Dependency

## Claim checked

an ordered dependency flows from an earlier Producer to a later Consumer, **and** the stored relation points from Consumer to Producer.

## Test case

Create three ordered peer Scope Units. Declare the first as Producer **and** the third as Consumer. Store `depends_on` from the third to the first. Reverse the production flow, reverse the stored relation, use equal order, **and** omit the dependency **in** separate fixtures.

## Acceptance criteria

**only** the earlier-Producer, later-Consumer fixture with the Consumer-to-Producer stored relation passes. Order alone creates no dependency.

## Failure disposition

Record a Concern naming the invalid ordered dependency.
