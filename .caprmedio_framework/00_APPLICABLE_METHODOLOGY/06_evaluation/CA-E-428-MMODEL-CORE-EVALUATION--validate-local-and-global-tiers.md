# Validate Local and Global Tiers

the Evaluation **must** reject a Project Goal whose Global Tier is not **`-1`** **or** that has a Local Tier, a Project-scoped Atom whose Principle, Core, **or** Standard Global Tier is not respectively **`0`**, **`1`**, **or** **`2`**, a non-Project Scope Unit Atom whose Core **or** Standard Global Tier does not follow the recursive parent rule, a Principle outside the Project, a Core Claim that does not apply to the full Scope of its current Scope Unit, a Standard Claim that does not apply to a proper part of that Scope, **or** a non-Project Goal that is not a Standard Atom of its direct parent Scope Unit.
