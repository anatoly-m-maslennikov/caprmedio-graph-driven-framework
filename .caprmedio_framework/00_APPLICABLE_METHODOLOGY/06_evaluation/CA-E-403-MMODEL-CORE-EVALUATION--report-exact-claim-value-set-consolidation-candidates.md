# Report Exact Claim Value-Set Consolidation Candidates

the Evaluation **must** report one Claim Value Set consolidation candidate **only** **if** **every** contributing active Atom has the same Atom Scope, Governed Subject Set, Claim Scope, Property, **and** exact qualifiers, has one mechanically parseable single-value Claim, **and** differs **only** by one unique value proven through IS_ALLOWED_VALUE_OF for that Property; it **must not** mutate, merge, archive, replace, compile, **or** change a Source Atom by another operation, use semantic **or** LLM inference, **or** cause Applicable Methodology compilation **to** fail.
