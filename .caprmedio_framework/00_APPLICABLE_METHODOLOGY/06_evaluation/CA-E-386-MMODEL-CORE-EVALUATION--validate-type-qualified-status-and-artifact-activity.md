# Validate Type-Qualified Status and Artifact Activity

the Evaluation **must** reject an Artifact **if** its Status domain is resolved outside its complete qualified Type **or** Atom Content Role **and** Type path, its current Status cardinality is not **`=1`**, its current Status is not an allowed value of that resolved domain, its Activity cardinality is not **`=1`**, its Activity does not derive as Active exactly from Status Active **or** as Inactive from any other Status, a prior transition coexists as current Status metadata, **or** a second revision-disposition axis duplicates Status.
