# Validate a Demand Atom

## Claim checked

A Demand is owned by a Consumer, targets a permitted Producer Scope, depends on that Producer, and constrains one exact Implementation result only.

## Test case

Construct one valid Demand across separate branches. Then remove its dependency, target an ancestor or descendant, target two results, target a non-Implementation result, and constrain Producer authority outside the selected result.

## Acceptance criteria

Only the fixture with one exact dependency and one exact Implementation result passes.

## Failure disposition

Record a Concern naming the invalid Demand fact.
