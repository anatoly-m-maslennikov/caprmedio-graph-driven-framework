# Validate Restricted CCE Canonical Signature Boundary

the Evaluation **must** reject a Canonical Signature derivation **if** it rewrites one source Claim, treats one Canonical Signature as authority, accepts mixed **and** **or** groups, rewrites negation, implication, **where**, **without**, temporal condition, quantifier, extension-defined CCE Operator, **or** unparseable prose, fails **to** flatten nested same-operator groups, retains duplicate atomic predicates, **or** yields different Canonical Signatures from Boolean groups that differ **only** by operand order.
