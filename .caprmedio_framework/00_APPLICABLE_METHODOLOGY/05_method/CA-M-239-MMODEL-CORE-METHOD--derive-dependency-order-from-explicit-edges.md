# Derive Dependency Order from Explicit Edges

**to** derive one dependency order, the resolver **must** construct one directed graph from direct `relations.depends_on` edges from **every** Consumer **to** **every** prerequisite Provider, derive its `required_by` inverse view **without** authoring inverse edges, calculate one deterministic prerequisite-first topological order with canonical identity **only** as a tie-breaker, **and** reject a cycle; it **must not** use target-list position, Local Order, **or** `relations.derived_from` as a dependency edge.
