# Exclude generated-only implementation edges

Commit-provenance validation inspects every commit in the governed range. A commit contributes an implementation relation, implementation coverage, or semantic traceability edge only when it changes at least one non-generated governed path.

A generated-only commit is an auditable refresh transaction. It retains its required provenance but cannot become an implementation input to the semantic graph that produced the generated carrier. A mixed commit participates because it includes a substantive governed change.
