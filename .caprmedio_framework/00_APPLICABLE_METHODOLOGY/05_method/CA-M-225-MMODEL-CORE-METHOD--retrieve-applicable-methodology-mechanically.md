# Retrieve Applicable Methodology Mechanically

**to** retrieve Applicable Methodology for one Subject **or** Process query, the Retriever **must** derive GOVERNS **and** DEPENDS_ON indexes on demand from projected Atom relations, select matching GOVERNS paths, add DEPENDS_ON authority **only** through transitive prerequisite closure, retain Applicable Methodology membership order, make no inference, **and** return no Atom **if** no matching GOVERNS path exists.
