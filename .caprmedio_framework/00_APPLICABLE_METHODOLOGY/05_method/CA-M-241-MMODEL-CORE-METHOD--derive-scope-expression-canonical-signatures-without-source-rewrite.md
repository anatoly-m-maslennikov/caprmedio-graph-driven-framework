# Derive Canonical Scope Signatures Without Source Rewrite

**to** derive Canonical Scope Signatures from one caller-selected Atom Carrier folder, the Tool **must** inspect **only** active Carriers with **`=1`** unwrapped Scope Expression **in** one `## Scope` section, resolve **every** atomic identity against active Atom IDs **in** that selected folder, derive a signature **only** **if** the Scope Expression satisfies the restricted Canonical Scope Signature grammar, emit source identity, source revision, source Carrier digest, source frontier digest, source expression, signature, **and** exclusion diagnostic, **and** make no source-Carrier rewrite, lifecycle change, Claim merge, authority decision, **or** dependency relation.
