# Govern the archive-based Atom lifecycle

TO govern an Atom lifecycle, the Operator or Agent MUST PERFORM ALL OF:

1. Keep a mutable unaccepted Atom in the role-local `drafts/` place without an assigned Atom ID.
2. Keep an accepted current Atom directly in its Content-role place.
3. Keep a closed Concern in `solved/` and a completed Analysis or Plan in `done/` when preserved as post-acceptance evidence.
4. Move a replaced, retired, or otherwise historical Atom Revision to the role-local `archive/` place.
5. Preserve an assigned Atom ID across lifecycle moves.
6. Encode every archived Revision filename with its metadata version suffix.
7. Create a new draft and new Atom ID when an archived matter recurs.
