# Bounded scripted migrations

A migration script MUST be scoped to named carriers or exact patterns, fail when an expected source pattern is absent, and leave reviewable repository diffs. It does not rewrite immutable atomic artifacts unless a separately accepted carrier migration explicitly authorizes that transformation.
