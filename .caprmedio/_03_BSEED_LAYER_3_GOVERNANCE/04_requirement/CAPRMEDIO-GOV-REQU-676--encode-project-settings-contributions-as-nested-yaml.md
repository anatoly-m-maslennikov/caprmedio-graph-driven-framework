# Encode configuration surfaces in owning Atoms

GOV may encode an owning Atom's optional machine-readable contribution to generated Project Graph State under one top-level `project_graph_state` YAML map only when it faithfully represents that Atom's own governed claim. It may declare registered facts, allowed values, defaults, or structural contributions, but must not encode current operator-selected configuration values or a `project_settings` contribution; current selections belong only to the Project Configuration Atom.
