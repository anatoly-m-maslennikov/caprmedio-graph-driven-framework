# Register dependent-to-subject relations

GOV registers the following directed relations. The artifact on the left stores the relation to its pre-existing subject on the right:

| Relation | Owning artifact | Allowed target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `derived_from` | internal Concern, Analysis, Plan, Requirement, Method, Evaluation, Delivery, or Rationale Atom | source Analysis Atom |
| `rationale_for` | Rationale Analysis Atom | Requirement, Method, Evaluation, or Delivery Atom |
| `method_for` | Method Atom | Requirement Atom |
| `evaluation_for` | Evaluation Atom | Requirement or Method Atom |
| `delivery_for` | Delivery Atom | Requirement or Method Atom |
| `implementation_of` | governed Implementation carrier | specification Atom |
| `evidence_for` | Evidence carrier | Evaluation or Implementation carrier |
| `concern_about` | Concern Atom | Observation or another directly affected artifact |

Each relation is persisted only by its owning artifact. Inverse navigation is derived and must not be stored as a backlink. An artifact may store both `derived_from` and another registered relation when they express different direct facts, such as a Rationale derived from an Analysis Report and explaining a Requirement.

The registered relations do not imply transitive links. Additional relation meanings require separate GOV authority rather than reuse of the nearest-sounding relation.
