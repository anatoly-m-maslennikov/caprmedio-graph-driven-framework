# Active Atom history correctness

## Claim checked

The generated history reports a replayable daily active-Atom series whose total and Type, structural-level, and structural-unit rollups reconcile at every date.

## Applicable conditions

1. Build a Git fixture spanning several dates in the configured timezone with dates that contain multiple commits and dates without commits; create, move, archive, and reactivate Atoms of multiple Types across structural units and change the topology in one historical revision.
2. Generate the history and require exactly `<project-control-root>/biz_atoms_active_history.md`, the last authoritative revision at or before each date's end, and carry-forward values on dates without a new revision.
3. For every date require one correct grand total, all registered Type, structural-level, and structural-unit members including zero counts, and every dimension rollup sum equal to the date's grand total.
4. Require lifecycle and topology interpretation from each historical revision rather than the current working tree; alter filesystem timestamps without changing Git history and require byte-identical semantic output.
5. Add an uninterpretable historical carrier without a compatibility rule and require a build error; then provide the governed rule and require the correct replayed count.
6. Generate twice from one Git frontier, date range, timezone, and configuration and require byte-stable semantic output; extend the frontier and require currentness failure until the completed atomic rebuild records it.

## Acceptance criteria

Every reporting date uses the correct authoritative revision and exposes exact, zero-inclusive, reconciling active-Atom totals and rollups with deterministic replay and currentness.

## Failure disposition

Reject the history, retain the previous current Projection, report the first missing date, wrong frontier, malformed historical carrier, incorrect lifecycle interpretation, non-reconciling count, or stale result, and record a Concern before publication.
