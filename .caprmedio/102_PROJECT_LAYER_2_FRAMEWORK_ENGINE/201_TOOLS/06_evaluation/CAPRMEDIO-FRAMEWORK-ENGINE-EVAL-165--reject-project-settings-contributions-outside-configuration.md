# Reject Project Settings contributions outside Configuration

## Test case

**Fixture:** Add a `project_settings` map to any active Atom other than the
governed Project Configuration Atom.

**Expected result:** Generation fails before either output changes and reports
that current operator-selected settings have a second owner.
