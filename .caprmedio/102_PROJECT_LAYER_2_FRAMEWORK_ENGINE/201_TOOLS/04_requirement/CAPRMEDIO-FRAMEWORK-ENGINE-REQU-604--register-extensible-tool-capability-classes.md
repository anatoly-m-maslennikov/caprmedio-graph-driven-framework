# Register extensible Tool capability classes

Every Tool must register exactly one primary Tool kind: `finder` for strictly read-only retrieval or evaluation, or `doer` for governed mutation or materialization. `checker` is a registered Finder specialization that applies explicit Evaluation criteria and returns issues, evidence, or a verdict; additional specializations may extend a primary kind only through explicit registration of their semantics and interface obligations.
