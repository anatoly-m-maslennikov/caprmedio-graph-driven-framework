# Verify changed source boundary or exception

## Claim checked

One changed hand-authored PROGRAMMATIC Python source carrier satisfies the
source-size ratchet or records its required bounded exception.

## Applicable conditions

Apply to a new or materially changed hand-authored Python file. Generated
Runtime and Delivery outputs are not applicable.

## Test case

Evaluate one changed executable unit exceeding 40 logical lines without a
documented exception.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the carrier is rejected until it is split, reduced, or supplied
with one specific documented exception that retains its single responsibility.

## Failure disposition

Block the changed source from claiming source-boundary conformance.
