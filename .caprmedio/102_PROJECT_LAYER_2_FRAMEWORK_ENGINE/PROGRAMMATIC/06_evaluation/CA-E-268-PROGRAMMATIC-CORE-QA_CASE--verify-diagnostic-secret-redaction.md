# Verify diagnostic secret redaction

## Claim checked

One PROGRAMMATIC diagnostic path sanitizes a sensitive input before its record
is exposed to the declared sink.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a diagnostic path could receive sensitive or secret-bearing input.
Paths whose declared inputs contain no such value are not applicable.

## Test case

Supply one secret-bearing input to one declared diagnostic path.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the exposed record retains the diagnostic context while omitting
or irreversibly redacting the secret-bearing value.

## Failure disposition

Stop the diagnostic path and correct its sanitization boundary before release.
