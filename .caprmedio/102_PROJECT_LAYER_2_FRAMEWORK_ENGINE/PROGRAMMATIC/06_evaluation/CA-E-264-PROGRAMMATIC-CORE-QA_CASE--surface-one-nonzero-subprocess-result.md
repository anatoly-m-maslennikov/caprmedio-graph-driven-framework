# Surface one nonzero subprocess result

## Claim checked

One PROGRAMMATIC subprocess boundary observes and returns a non-zero exit
status with the context required for diagnosis or recovery.

## Applicable conditions

Apply only when a component invokes a subprocess. Components without a
subprocess boundary are not applicable.

## Test case

Invoke one declared subprocess that returns a non-zero exit status.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the boundary reports the explicit status and declared input
context without treating the invocation as successful.

## Failure disposition

Stop the affected operation and return the failure to its caller or recovery
owner.
