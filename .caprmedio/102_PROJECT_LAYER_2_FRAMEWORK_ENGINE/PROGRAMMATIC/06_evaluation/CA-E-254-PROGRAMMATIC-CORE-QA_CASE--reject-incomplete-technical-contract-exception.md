# Reject incomplete technical-contract exception

## Claim checked

One proposed PROGRAMMATIC dependency or non-Python exception has every record
required by the technical contract before it can be accepted.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when one changed component requires a dependency or non-Python exception
to the default technical boundary.

## Test case

Evaluate one proposed exception whose record omits one required capability,
bounded-carrier, interface, boundary-cost, evidence, or Operator-acceptance
field.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the incomplete exception is rejected without admitting the
affected component.

## Failure disposition

Block the exception and the affected component until one complete bounded
record is available.
