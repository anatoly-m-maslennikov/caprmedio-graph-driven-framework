# Verify owned state and lifecycle boundary

## Claim checked

One PROGRAMMATIC object that owns state, a resource, a lifecycle, or a
replaceable adapter exposes one bounded ownership and lifecycle boundary.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component retains mutable state, acquires or releases a resource,
transitions through a lifecycle, or encapsulates one replaceable adapter.

## Test case

Evaluate one object through its declared acquisition, use, failure, and
release or recovery transition.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when each declared transition is observable, one owner remains
responsible for the state or resource, and no unrelated deterministic
responsibility is required to complete the transition.

## Failure disposition

Stop the object boundary and split or redesign it before release.
