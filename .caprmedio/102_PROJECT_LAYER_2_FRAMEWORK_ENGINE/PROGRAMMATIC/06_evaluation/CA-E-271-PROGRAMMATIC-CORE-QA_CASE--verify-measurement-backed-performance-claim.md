# Verify measurement-backed performance claim

## Claim checked

One PROGRAMMATIC performance claim is supported by a representative workload,
preserved baseline, observed distribution, and comparable observation.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component proposes or assesses a performance-sensitive change.
No numerical budget is implied where no bounded owner has admitted one.

## Test case

Evaluate one claimed performance change against its selected surface and
recorded baseline.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the workload input, environment, baseline, observed
distribution, and comparison threshold are recoverable and support the stated
claim.

## Failure disposition

Reject the performance claim without a representative baseline; do not invent
a numeric budget.
