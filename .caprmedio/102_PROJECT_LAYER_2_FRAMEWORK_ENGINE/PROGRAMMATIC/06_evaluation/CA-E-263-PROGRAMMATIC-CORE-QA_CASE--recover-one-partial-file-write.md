# Recover one partial file write

## Claim checked

One interrupted PROGRAMMATIC file replacement preserves or explicitly reports
its declared recovery boundary without guessing at a completed result.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component writes replacement content through a temporary carrier
or otherwise has a declared partial-write recovery boundary.

## Test case

Interrupt one replacement after its temporary carrier is prepared but before
the declared replacement completes.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the original target or a declared recoverable result remains
identifiable, no false completion is reported, and the partial state is
diagnosable from the returned context.

## Failure disposition

Stop the mutation path until its weaker recovery boundary is explicit or its
atomic replacement guarantee is restored.
