# Verify structured diagnostic schema

## Claim checked

One PROGRAMMATIC operational diagnostic uses an admitted severity and provides
the actionable contextual fields required by its declared schema.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component emits a diagnostic for normal operation, degraded
operation, failure, recovery, or diagnostic detail.

## Test case

Evaluate one emitted diagnostic record for a declared component event.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the record uses ERROR, WARNING, INFO, or DEBUG, includes its
declared actionable contextual fields, and does not repurpose Journal history
as an operational diagnostic.

## Failure disposition

Reject the diagnostic path until its schema and severity are corrected.
