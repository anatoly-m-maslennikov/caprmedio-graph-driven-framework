# Recover an interrupted stateful lifecycle after restart

## Claim checked

One recoverable PROGRAMMATIC lifecycle reports or restores its declared state
after interruption and restart without inventing completion.

## Applicable conditions

Apply only when a component owns recoverable lifecycle state. Stateless
transformations and non-recoverable lifecycles are not applicable.

## Test case

Interrupt one lifecycle after a declared transition but before its declared
completion, then restart its owner.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the restarted owner exposes the declared recovered, pending, or
failed state and does not report the interrupted work as complete.

## Failure disposition

Stop the lifecycle claim until its recovery boundary is made explicit.
