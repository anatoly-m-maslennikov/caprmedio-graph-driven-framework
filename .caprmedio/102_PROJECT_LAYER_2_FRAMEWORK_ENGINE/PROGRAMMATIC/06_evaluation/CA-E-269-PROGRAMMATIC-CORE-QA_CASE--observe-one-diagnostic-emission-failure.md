# Observe one diagnostic emission failure

## Claim checked

One failure to emit a PROGRAMMATIC operational diagnostic is observable and
does not silently break the primary work.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component has a declared operational-diagnostic path and a
separate primary work outcome.

## Test case

Cause one declared diagnostic emission to fail while the associated primary
work remains otherwise executable.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the primary work reaches its declared outcome or failure
boundary, and the diagnostic-emission failure is itself observable through its
declared recovery or reporting path.

## Failure disposition

Reject the diagnostic path when it hides its own failure or silently changes
the primary work result.
