# Verify declared interface compatibility

## Claim checked

One changed declared PROGRAMMATIC public or host interface preserves its
accepted compatibility behavior or has an accepted bounded replacement.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a Tool, App backend service, or MCP component changes a declared
technical interface, host integration, transport, or dependency-facing
boundary. A component without such a declared boundary is not applicable.

## Test case

Invoke one changed declared boundary through the behavior accepted by its
current Requirement, technical contract, or pinned external origin.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the invocation preserves the declared behavior or returns the
accepted replacement behavior, without implying an undeclared platform or
cross-host compatibility claim.

## Failure disposition

Stop release and compatibility claims until the boundary has current authority
or an accepted replacement.
