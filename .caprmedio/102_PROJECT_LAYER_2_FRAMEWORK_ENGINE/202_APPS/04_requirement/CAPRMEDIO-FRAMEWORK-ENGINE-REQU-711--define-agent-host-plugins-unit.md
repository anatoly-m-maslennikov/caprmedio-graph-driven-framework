# Define the AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS unit

`AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS` with prefix `AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS` must be one `unordered_unit` owned immediately by `APPS` at Structural level `3`, addressed by `002_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/APPS/AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS`, and realized under `002_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/APPS/AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS/`; it owns installable agent-host-specific plugin packages and their host wiring without duplicating provider-neutral CAPRMEDIO Skill, Tool, or Methodology behavior.
