# Deliver the Requirement Projection browser locally

The active Requirement Projection browser must be delivered as exactly one project-local, non-authoritative `.caprmedio/mrt_atoms.html` file with embedded JavaScript, launched through the shared Tool environment and backed by strictly read-only access to the current per-structural-unit Requirement STG files and actual Atom Markdown; this Delivery creates no sibling web assets and does not publish, host, or distribute the MRT outside the project.
