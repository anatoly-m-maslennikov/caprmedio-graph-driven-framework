# Preserve GitHub preview compatibility

Every CAPRMEDIO-owned Markdown, TOML, or YAML artifact must remain legible and navigable in GitHub's repository file preview.

Markdown artifacts must:

- use valid YAML frontmatter and GitHub Flavored Markdown;
- use repository-relative Markdown links and image paths;
- use only GitHub-supported alerts: `NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, and
  `CAUTION`;
- use `<details><summary>` for collapsible sections;
- use fenced `mermaid` blocks for diagrams; and
- avoid Obsidian wiki links, embeds, and Obsidian-only callout syntax.

TOML artifacts must:

- remain valid UTF-8 TOML;
- be understandable in GitHub's source view without a generated renderer;
- use descriptive keys, comments, and section ordering when they materially
  improve readability; and
- avoid encoding required meaning only through editor-specific behavior.

YAML artifacts must:

- remain valid UTF-8 YAML;
- expose branching structure through descriptive keys and consistent indentation;
- remain understandable without a generated renderer; and
- avoid encoding required meaning only through anchors, tags, or editor-specific behavior.

GitHub-preview compatibility does not require GitHub Pages publication or
prevent other consumers from rendering the same portable files.
