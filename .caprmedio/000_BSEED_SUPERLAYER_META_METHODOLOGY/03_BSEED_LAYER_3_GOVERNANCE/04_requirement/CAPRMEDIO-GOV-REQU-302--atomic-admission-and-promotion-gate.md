# Gate atomic admission and promotion

The Project Configuration Atom selects `medium` or `high` through `artifacts.creation_strictness`; the default is `medium`.

At medium strictness, CAPRMEDIO requires accepted authority, one primary claim, one
enabled artifact type, owning scope, creation provenance, material relations,
priority, and sufficient precision to establish a stable artifact identity and
initial committed revision. Optional non-authoritative context may remain
explicitly unknown.

At high strictness, CAPRMEDIO stops before emission while any material authority,
meaning, boundary, classification, scope, lineage, conflict, or evaluation
question remains ambiguous. It asks focused questions until the atom meets the
same one-primary-claim identity standard.

Both levels assess one-step promotion eligibility. Promotion is proposed only
when the claim applies unchanged at the broader enabled scope and always
requires explicit operator acceptance.

Admission does not prohibit later same-ID revisions. Every later change passes
the atomic change-class gate; changing the primary claim identity requires a
replacement.
