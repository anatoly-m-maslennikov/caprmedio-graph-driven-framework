# Generated-only provenance boundary

## Claim checked

Every commit retains auditable provenance, while only commits containing a
non-generated governed change contribute Implementation relations and
coverage.

## Applicable conditions

1. Validate required provenance on substantive, generated-only, and mixed
   commits.
2. Include substantive and mixed commits in derived implementation relations
   and coverage.
3. Exclude generated-only commits from those relations and coverage.
4. Confirm generated-only commits remain visible in Git audit history.
5. Reject a generated carrier that cites itself as its semantic input.

## Acceptance criteria

All commits retain auditable provenance, while only commits with at least one
non-generated governed change contribute implementation edges.

## Failure disposition

Reject the derived relation or coverage result and record a Concern naming the
misclassified commit.
