# Define the TARGET_SET Tool unit

`TARGET_SET` must be one Finder Tool owned immediately by `TOOLS` as an `unordered_unit` at Structural level `3`, addressed by `FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/TOOLS/TARGET_SET`, and realized under `FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/TOOLS/TARGET_SET/`; it resolves explicit identities and composable governed selectors into one stably ordered target set with its complete membership, source frontier, and content digest before another Tool evaluates or changes those targets.
