# Classify rename as UPDATE

## Claim checked

A filename-only rename of one governed file identity without Structural relocation is classified only as `UPDATE`.

## Test case

Supply a trigger for one identity whose filename changes while content, Structural location, governed meaning, and version remain unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria

The sealed context reports `UPDATE`, records both filenames, preserves the version, and does not report `MOVE`.

## Failure disposition

Reject classification and report any identity split, version change, or competing change set.
