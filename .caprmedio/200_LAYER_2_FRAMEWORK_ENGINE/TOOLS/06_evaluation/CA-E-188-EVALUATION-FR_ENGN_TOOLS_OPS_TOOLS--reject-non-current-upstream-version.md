# Reject a non-current upstream version

## Claim checked

The commit flow cannot seal or apply a typed upstream relation whose target version is not current immediately before the file change.

## Test case

Prepare one `UPDATE` fixture whose direct upstream target is at version 3, then supply a candidate context that names version 2 for that same target.

## Acceptance criteria

The flow returns a deterministic non-current-upstream-version diagnostic, names both versions, and creates no governed or Git state change.

## Failure disposition

Reject the flow if it accepts, silently rewrites, or omits the stale target reference.
