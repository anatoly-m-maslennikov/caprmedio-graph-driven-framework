# Validate the structured file-change event schema

## Claim checked

Every completed `governed_file_change` event has canonical structured LLM-session and occurrence-time provenance and does not duplicate that provenance, prior state, or the projected Git message.

## Test case

Validate one event for each action type against the registered schema, then inject an absent or malformed `llm_session.app`, `llm_session.uuid`, or timezone-qualified `occurred_at`, a pre-rendered combined session string, another absent required field, an invalid state-dependent field, `action_message`, `before_path`, and `before_sha256` in separate runs.

## Acceptance criteria

Each valid event passes and can derive `<app>:<uuid>:<occurred_at>` from structured fields; each malformed event fails with a stable field-specific diagnostic; `sources` is ordered; `result` is singular; and forbidden duplicated fields are rejected.

## Failure disposition

Reject the Journal record when its structure or LLM-session provenance is incomplete, ambiguous, action-inconsistent, or duplicates derivable state.
