# Reject incomplete relation-kind metadata

## Claim checked

Deterministic Tools cannot use a relation kind whose canonical registry entry is incomplete.

## Test case

Compile a fixture registry containing one otherwise valid direct relation whose derived inverse name or upstream endpoint is absent, then gather commit context for a file using that relation.

## Acceptance criteria

Registry compilation fails with the exact missing field, context gathering returns no sealed envelope, and no governed or Git state changes.

## Failure disposition

Reject the registry compiler and Finder if either infers the missing field or continues with a partial relation entry.
