# Define CAPRMEDIO structural topology

CAPRMEDIO assigns METAMODEL, SEMANTICS, and GOVERNANCE as ordered Bootstrap Seed Layers at Structural coordinates `-1/1`, `-1/2`, and `-1/3`; PROJECT as the `project_root` at level `0`; ordered Project Layers and unordered direct Project children as Structural units at level `1`; and Layer-owned Features as `unordered_unit`s at level `2`.
