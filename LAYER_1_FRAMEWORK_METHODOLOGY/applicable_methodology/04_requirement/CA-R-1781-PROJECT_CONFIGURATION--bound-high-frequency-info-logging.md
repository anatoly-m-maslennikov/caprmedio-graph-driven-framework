# Summary

Bound high-frequency INFO logging

## Scope

logging Implementation for high-frequency success, polling, **and** progress events under production Logging Policies.

## Claim

logging Implementation **must** bound high-frequency success, polling, **and** progress events through aggregation, sampling, **or** emission as `DEBUG` **where** appropriate rather than creating unbounded `INFO` noise.

## Details

the alternatives bound repeated normal-event volume; the severity taxonomy separately classifies material operational milestones.
