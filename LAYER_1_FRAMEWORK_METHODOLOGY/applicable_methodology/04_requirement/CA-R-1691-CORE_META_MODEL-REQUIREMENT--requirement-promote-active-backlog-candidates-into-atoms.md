# Summary

Requirement — Promote active backlog candidates into Atoms

## Scope

Development Backlog candidates selected into active work.

## Claim

assigning a Development Backlog candidate **to** a current **or** future version does **not** establish governed truth. the candidate becomes active work **only** **when** the operator selects it **and** CAPRMEDIO creates **`=1`** bounded Task Atom for its action. execution **then** materializes the minimum Requirement, Method, Evaluation, Delivery, **or** future Operations Atoms needed **to** govern that work.

**`=1`** backlog line **may** produce multiple Atoms. multiple closely related backlog lines **may** produce **`=1`** Concern **or** RMED Atom **only** **when** they resolve **to** **`=1`** independently replaceable claim. Analysis, Task, Implementation, **and** Operations use their separately governed atomicity models.

the backlog entry **may** link the resulting Atoms for navigation but remains a non-authoritative planning candidate **until** release finalization removes **or** reschedules it.

## Details

a Development Backlog candidate becomes active **only** through a bounded Task Atom; specification **or** other semantic authority arises **only** from the applicable CAPRMEDIO Atoms created **or** revised during execution.
