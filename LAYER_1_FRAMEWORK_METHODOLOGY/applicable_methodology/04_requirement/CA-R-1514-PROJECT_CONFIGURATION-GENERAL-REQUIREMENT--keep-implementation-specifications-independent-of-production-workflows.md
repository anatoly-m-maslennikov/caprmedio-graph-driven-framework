# Summary

Keep Implementation specifications independent of production Workflows

## Scope

the CAPRMEDIO Project's governing RMED for an Implementation.

## Claim

**in** the CAPRMEDIO Project, governing RMED **must** fully specify the required Implementation independently of the Workflow used **to** produce it.

## Details

- conformity depends on the resulting Implementation satisfying its RMED, **not** on following a particular production Workflow. different Workflows, **or** work **without** a formally defined Workflow, **may** produce a conforming Implementation.
- ordinary implementation RMED **must not** leave required behavior specified **only** **in** an O Atom **or** require an O Atom as its production procedure.
- the permitted authority references are the Tool realization binding under CA-R-1516-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-REQUIREMENT--bind-each-tool-to-one-methodology-action **and** CA-R-1517-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-REQUIREMENT--keep-tool-operational-authority-outside-its-own-subtree, **and** methodology checks of Action **and** Workflow definitions under CA-R-1518-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--separate-methodology-and-tool-evaluation-responsibilities. neither exception makes the Workflow used **to** build the Implementation part of its specification.
- a generic executor **may** consume applicable O definitions as runtime inputs under CA-R-1519-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--require-conforming-workflow-execution. its RMED **must** fully specify how it interprets those inputs; the selected Workflow is **not** its production procedure **or** an independently copied part of its Spec.

these are CAPRMEDIO Project Configuration boundaries, **not** a change **to** the reusable Core Meta-Model Content Roles.
