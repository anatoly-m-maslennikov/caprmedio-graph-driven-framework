## Summary

Define composition and its inverse

## Claim

### Prose Claim

IS_CONTAINED_BY relates a contained declared Entity or instance to its immediate Container. The Target has classification `Container = yes`. Containment does not imply narrowing or inheritance. CONTAINS is its derived inverse: its Host and Target are the direct Target and Host, respectively. Store the direct fact once.
### Formal Claim

```CFEL
# model
$part ((IS_CONTAINED_BY)) $container;

Relation//IS_CONTAINED_BY ((HAS_INVERSE)) Relation//CONTAINS;

alias(Relation//IS_CONTAINED_BY) == "+>";

Relation//IS_CONTAINED_BY ((HAS_CLASSIFICATION)) Derivation == Direct
```
