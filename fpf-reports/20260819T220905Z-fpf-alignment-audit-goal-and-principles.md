## Task, scope, and boundaries

Task: perform a read-only FPF alignment audit of the current CAPRMEDIO Goal and active Project-level Principle Requirements.

Receiving use: decide whether this semantic foundation is coherent enough to review and later compress into a Definition above Project level. This report does not accept that proposed Definition, change project authority, provide project assurance, or authorize implementation.

Saved report: fpf-reports/20260819T220905Z-fpf-alignment-audit-goal-and-principles.md

Target and current state:

- One Goal carrier: `.caprmedio/CAPRMEDIO-GOAL-001--enable-any-operator-to-build-a-working-system.md`.
- Fourteen active `tier: principle` Requirement carriers directly under `.caprmedio/04_requirement/`.
- All fourteen Principles currently name the Goal as their sole `child_of` parent.
- The inspected Goal and Principle carriers are present in the working tree but are currently untracked by Git. The audit therefore binds to the observed filesystem snapshot, not a committed revision.
- Project settings currently register the ordinary RMED tier order as `principle`, `core`, `standard`; Goal is a separately enabled Requirement subtype.

Claims tested:

1. Any operator can turn a feasible intent into a working system given sufficient time and effort.
2. The graph is the operating model.
3. CAPRMEDIO admits only necessary complexity.
4. CAPRMEDIO scales through structure and selective exposure.
5. Extensions add governed capabilities without copying canonical authority.
6. Configuration selects capabilities without changing their meanings.
7. Canonical decompositions are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive within a declared universe.
8. Each governed meaning has one canonical owner.
9. Every governed claim is falsifiable, testable for satisfaction, or explicitly bounded in applicability.
10. Every governed reliance states evidence, material uncertainty, and stop or reopen conditions.
11. Canonical semantics remain discipline-independent while adaptations carry discipline-specific meaning.
12. Authority and semantics remain independent of named technical substrates.
13. The operator retains full sovereignty over the current project.
14. Governed authority is organized as explicit configurable hierarchies in the typed graph.
15. Material observed outcomes drive governed, evaluated improvement at the narrowest affected scope.

Resolved FPF source: the split `FPF-Knowledge-Graph` edition generated on 2026-08-02 from `FPF-Spec.md` revision `9a9a42e4d154021ca3f7415e0009a4214832f65f`. The Practical-Use Cards routed working-document reliance to A.10 and improvement to E.23. Six direct pages were inspected, which exhausted the skill's default direct-pattern budget.

Inspected project evidence: exact Goal and Principle bodies, tier metadata, direct parent relations, Principle ordering metadata, current tier settings, Git source status, and whitespace/diff hygiene. Inspected FPF evidence: the direct pages listed under `FPF sources consulted` below.

Explicit exclusions: the unaccepted ephemerality draft, the proposed Definition, all Core and Standard Requirements, conflict-handling Requirements below Principle tier, README wording, projections, user documentation, implementation, engine behavior, tests, lifecycle/admission conformance, and release state. These exclusions prevent this report from claiming that a missing Principle-level boundary is or is not supplied downstream.

Acceptance condition for this audit: every boundedly supported claim must have recoverable project evidence and direct FPF support with no blocker inside the declared scope. Refusal condition: a missing direct page, missing project dependency, unbounded claim, or semantic conflict produces `insufficient basis` or `unsupported`, never an inferred pass.

Stop condition: the six-direct-page budget is exhausted and the exact current carriers have been inspected. Return when the Goal or a Principle changes, a Definition is admitted, conflict classification or precedence changes, the target is committed as a new revision, or one of the named additional FPF pages is opened for a follow-up audit.

## High-confidence results (>=95%)

### Audit contract, resolved FPF source, and inspected scope

The audit contract above is sufficient to judge the current Goal wording, Principle-level relation shape, and the claims directly governed by E.3, E.14, A.10, A.11, and A.22. A.5 was also read, but it declares itself a transitional informative stub and redirects enforceable extension boundaries elsewhere. Claims whose direct governor was not inspected are marked `insufficient basis`.

The project files are direct project evidence. FPF pages are an external review lens, not CAPRMEDIO authority. Every interpretation below is labeled as a reviewer finding; no finding changes either source.

### Per-claim alignment matrix

| Claim and Entity of Concern | Direct FPF basis and expected result | Project evidence and observed state | Finding, confidence, dependencies, and return condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goal — enable any operator to build a working system** | E.14 requires the shortest working sentence to name the governed object, bounded claim, and supported use, with heavier support recoverable when reliance matters (`E.14`, lines 28–36 and 63–85). | The Goal uses `any operator`, `sufficient time and effort`, `feasible intent`, and `working system` without defining the operator class, feasibility boundary, observable working condition, excluded systems, or stopping condition (`Goal`, lines 14–18). Its child Principle REQU-022 requires every governed claim to expose falsification, unsatisfied state, or applicability boundary (`REQU-022`, lines 16–18). | **Unsupported — 99%.** Reviewer inference: the Goal is aspirational but is stored as a governed Requirement and contradicts the testability rule applied to all governed claims. Uninspected dependencies: any Core definitions of operator, feasibility, or working system. Return when those exact boundaries are incorporated or the Goal is explicitly exempted from REQU-022 by accepted authority. |
| **REQU-004 — graph is the operating model** | A.10 requires every graph edge to represent an independently governed direct relation and forbids graph membership from creating facts (`A.10`, lines 49–57, 78–85, 109–127, and 337–366). A.22 separates selected organization from graphs, views, and carriers (`A.22`, lines 79–120 and 416–454). | REQU-004 requires governance operations to read or change the typed graph of authority, realization bindings, and direct relations (`REQU-004`, lines 14–16). It does not explicitly say that graph membership creates those facts. | **Boundedly supported — 96%.** Reviewer inference: the operating-model claim is compatible only if the graph represents independently established authority and relations. The missing explicit non-reification boundary is a residual gap. Return if Definition wording says the graph itself establishes truth, work, evidence, or relation occurrence. |
| **REQU-005 — necessary complexity only** | A.11 admits durable ontology only after composition, non-redundancy, action-facing contribution, and sharp-boundary tests, with a reopen condition (`A.11`, lines 61–90 and 124–164). | REQU-005 permits a new mechanism only when needed to preserve a material governed distinction or required outcome (`REQU-005`, lines 16–18). | **Boundedly supported — 98%.** The action-facing and material-loss direction matches A.11. The four admission gates and reopen condition are not in the Principle carrier and may belong in uninspected Core rules. Return if downstream rules do not supply composition, overlap, boundary, and reopen tests. |
| **REQU-034 — scale through structure** | E.14 favors a small working model with deeper support available on demand (`E.14`, lines 28–35, 67–85, and 120–137). A.22 requires preserved and lost structure plus a return condition when selective views hide action-relevant distinctions (`A.22`, lines 99–120 and 416–454). | REQU-034 preserves necessary information and manages volume through structure and selective exposure rather than lossy omission (`REQU-034`, lines 14–16). | **Boundedly supported — 98%.** The Principle matches both selective exposure and loss-awareness. A concrete structure-use return condition remains an uninspected downstream dependency. Return if selective exposure can silently hide information needed for action. |
| **REQU-009 — extensibility adds governed capabilities** | A.5 supports a stable minimal core, domain extensions, explicit imports/provides, and separate dependency and specialization relations (`A.5`, lines 26–67). However, A.5 explicitly declares itself a transitional informative stub and redirects enforceable boundaries to A.6 and E.5.3 (`A.5`, lines 24 and 60–67). | REQU-009 requires explicit extension points and prohibits copying or silent redefinition of canonical authority (`REQU-009`, lines 15–17). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** The direction is compatible, but the inspected source is not the enforceable governor. Exact next sources: A.6.0, A.6.1, and E.5.3. Return after those pages and the relevant CAPRMEDIO extension-boundary dependencies are inspected. |
| **REQU-010 — configurability selects capabilities** | A.5 distinguishes a stable core from extension vocabularies and separates dependency from specialization, but delegates enforceable boundary semantics (`A.5`, lines 48–67). | REQU-010 permits project-owned selection, combination, parameterization, and disabling without changing governed meanings (`REQU-010`, lines 15–17). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** No inspected direct page governs the exact configuration-versus-meaning boundary. Exact next sources: A.6.0, A.6.1, and E.5.3. Return with the project configuration contract and those pages. |
| **REQU-002 — MECE canonical decompositions** | E.3 supports categorical clarity and exactly one class per Principle (`E.3`, lines 33–53). A.11 supplies non-redundancy and sharp-boundary pressure for ontology additions (`A.11`, lines 71–90). Neither inspected page directly governs a general mutually-exclusive-and-exhaustive decomposition claim. | REQU-002 limits MECE to a declared universe and one abstraction level (`REQU-002`, lines 14–16), which avoids an unbounded completeness claim. | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** No conflict was found, but direct FPF support was not inspected. Exact next source: A.7 Strict Distinction; add the direct decomposition governor if A.7 redirects further. |
| **REQU-003 — DRY governed meaning** | A.11 rejects overlapping durable values and requires reuse attempts (`A.11`, lines 83–90 and 132–164), but it does not establish the exact rule that one canonical owner must store every governed meaning. | REQU-003 names one canonical owner and allows reference, derivation, generation, or adaptation elsewhere (`REQU-003`, lines 13–15). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** The claim is compatible with the inspected non-redundancy pressure but lacks a direct governing page. Exact next sources: A.7 and F.8 Mint-or-Reuse Decision, followed by the publication/source pattern if canonical projections are in scope. |
| **REQU-022 — require falsifiable claims** | A.10 requires an exact relied-on claim, bounded use, rival explanation, uncertainty/currentness, challenge path, and reopen trigger (`A.10`, lines 47–85, 109–127, and 337–366). E.14 requires human working claims to retain recoverable support and limits (`E.14`, lines 114–137). | REQU-022 permits three forms of disconfirmation: false, unsatisfied, or outside applicability, and rejects confirmation-only evidence when a reasonable disconfirming check exists (`REQU-022`, lines 16–18). | **Boundedly supported — 97%.** The wording correctly covers empirical, normative, and applicability failures more broadly than empirical falsification alone. Uninspected dependency: claim-class-specific Evaluation Methods. Return if definitions or axioms are forced into empirical testing rather than given an appropriate satisfaction or boundary check. |
| **REQU-023 — explicit reliance boundaries** | A.10 directly requires exact claim and use, sources, work, direct owners, time/currentness, rival explanation, reliance disposition, and reopen trigger; missing support blocks only the affected use (`A.10`, lines 109–127 and 337–370). | REQU-023 requires evidence, material uncertainty, and stop/degrade/block/reopen conditions; missing or contradictory required input fails closed at the affected use (`REQU-023`, lines 16–18). | **Boundedly supported — 99%.** This is the strongest direct match in the set. The wording preserves local failure containment rather than converting one gap into universal rejection. Return when the allowed reliance dispositions or evidence/currentness model changes. |
| **REQU-013 — discipline-independent semantics** | A.5's problem and forces support a stable universal kernel with discipline-specific extensions (`A.5`, lines 26–55), but its enforceable solution is delegated elsewhere. | REQU-013 preserves one canonical model while Extensions and Project Adaptations specialize terminology, types, methods, evaluation, and implementation (`REQU-013`, lines 16–18). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** Directionally compatible, but the direct enforceable source and the project adaptation boundary were not inspected. Exact next sources: A.8 Universal Core Principle, A.6.0, A.6.1, and E.5.3. |
| **REQU-012 — replaceable substrates** | A.5 supports long-term semantic stability despite changing disciplines and implementations, but is informative and does not govern all named substrates (`A.5`, lines 26–67). | REQU-012 separates authority and semantics from operating system, operator language, programming language, LLM provider/model, and agent host (`REQU-012`, lines 15–17). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** Exact next source: E.5.2 Notational Independence, then the relevant signature/boundary pages for execution substrates. Return when those sources and any project substrate-binding rules are inspected. |
| **REQU-042 — operator sovereignty** | E.14 makes the human working model primary but does not grant unlimited ownership or override authority (`E.14`, lines 38–65 and 331–339). E.3 places law, regulation, guard rails, and assurance above lower project policy and uses multi-role gate authority for higher autonomy (`E.3`, lines 100–110 and 118–152). | REQU-042 grants the operator `full sovereignty` over the entire current project and every CAPRMEDIO Artifact without stating lawful, contractual, safety, privacy, or shared-authority boundaries (`REQU-042`, lines 14–16). | **Unsupported — 98%.** Reviewer inference: full control of project-owned sources may be intended, but `full sovereignty` is broader and conflicts with external obligations and explicitly shared decision authority. Return when sovereignty is narrowed to project-owned authority within declared external constraints, or when an accepted alternative precedence rule is supplied. |
| **REQU-044 — hierarchical graph of authority** | E.3 requires every Principle to have exactly one class, an acyclic precedence graph, and explicit conflict ordering (`E.3`, lines 40–78). A.22 requires exact constituents, obtaining relations, applied constraints, and a named use frame before a selected hierarchy can be relied on (`A.22`, lines 33–75 and 110–143). | All fourteen Principles are direct children of Goal, which is acyclic. Thirteen carry `principle_order` values 1–6 and 8–14; REQU-003 has no value 7. No Principle declares an E.3-like class or precedence edge, and ordering semantics are not stated in the inspected set. | **Unsupported — 99%.** The current star-shaped parent graph is explicit but does not resolve Principle conflicts. `principle_order` looks presentational and is mechanically incomplete. Uninspected dependencies may govern conflicts below Principle tier, but they cannot satisfy E.3's requirement that each Principle record carry a class. Return when a local class/precedence model or an explicit justified alternative is admitted. |
| **REQU-046 — improve from observed outcomes** | The Practical-Use Card routes repeated improvement to E.23 only after object version and evaluation basis exist (`Practical-Use Cards`, lines 106–112). E.23 was not opened because the six-page direct budget was exhausted. | REQU-046 requires material outcomes to produce governed, evaluated improvement at the narrowest affected scope (`REQU-046`, lines 14–16). | **Insufficient basis — 99%.** No semantic conflict was established, but direct support is missing. Exact next source: E.23 Quality Improvement Loop Method. Return with the relevant improvement Core dependencies and an exact object-version/evaluation example. |

All matrix rows share this bounded context: current Project-level constitutional authority, reviewed for later Definition synthesis. All carriers were inspected directly. Core/Standard expansion, project implementation, and runtime evidence remain uninspected for every row.

### Semantic blockers

1. **The Goal is not bounded enough to satisfy its own Principle set — 99%.** `Any operator`, `feasible intent`, `sufficient time and effort`, and `working system` allow every failed case to be reclassified after the fact. This blocks a recoverable success or failure judgment and therefore blocks honest compression into a Definition.
2. **The Principle set has no explicit conflict classification or precedence — 99%.** E.3 treats a flat list as ambiguous and requires one class per Principle plus an acyclic precedence model. CAPRMEDIO currently provides an incomplete `principle_order`, not conflict semantics. Likely live tensions include necessary complexity versus exhaustive coverage, stable semantics versus extensibility, and operator sovereignty versus reliance constraints.
3. **`Full sovereignty` is unbounded — 98%.** The phrase does not preserve external law, contractual commitments, safety/privacy limits, or multi-party authority. Full access and control over project-owned carriers is narrower than full sovereignty and would avoid this conflict.

### Structural or mechanical failures

1. **Principle ordering metadata is incomplete — 100%.** Thirteen active Principles have `principle_order`; REQU-003 has none, leaving value 7 absent between 6 and 8. No inspected authority states whether this field is display order or precedence, so the semantic consequence remains unresolved.
2. **The target snapshot is not Git-pinned — 100%.** The Goal and `.caprmedio/04_requirement/` tree are currently untracked. The report is replayable against current paths and contents but not against a committed target revision.
3. **No parent-cycle was found in the inspected set — 100%.** Every Principle points directly to Goal and Goal does not point back. This is a mechanical observation, not proof of complete authority topology.
4. **Diff hygiene passed for the inspected paths — 100%.** `git diff --check` reported no whitespace errors. This does not establish semantic alignment.

### Residual gaps and optional improvements

1. **Add the graph boundary before Definition compression — 97%.** State that the graph represents independently governed authority, work, evidence, and relations; graph membership does not create them. This preserves the useful operating-model claim while avoiding graph-as-truth overreach.
2. **Keep Principle wording compact but recoverable — 97%.** E.14 supports short human working text with deeper checks available below it. CAPRMEDIO's one-claim Principle carriers fit this direction, provided Core and Evaluation children supply the missing boundaries without back-defining the Principle wording.
3. **Use Principle candidacy as a constitutional test — 96%.** A new Principle should change the compact Definition or resolve a project-wide conflict. A rule that only operationalizes an existing Principle is more likely Core or Standard.
4. **Do not create the Definition from the current set yet — 98%.** Compression would hide the Goal ambiguity, sovereignty overreach, and unresolved Principle conflicts. Repair or explicitly disposition those issues first.
5. **The new ephemerality idea remains correctly excluded — 100%.** It is a draft candidate, not active Principle authority. A follow-up design review should test whether reusability is sufficient, necessary, or only one preservation reason before promotion.

### Excluded or uninspected claims

- The draft ephemerality Requirement and every other draft candidate.
- The proposed Definition, proposed Goal/Definition/Project tier shift, and proposed reparenting of Principles.
- Core and Standard descendants, including project conflict, strict/casual authority, extension, improvement, graph, and scope rules.
- README Principles and product-description prose.
- Whether project validators enforce tier lineage, relation direction, complete ordering, claim checks, or source currentness.
- Whether Implementation and Ops evidence satisfy any Principle.
- E.23 for improvement, A.7 for strict distinction/MECE, A.6.0/A.6.1/E.5.3 for extension boundaries, A.8 for universal-core discipline, E.5.2 for substrate independence, and F.8 for mint-or-reuse/DRY.

### Bounded verdict and stop/return condition

**Bounded verdict: `unsupported`.** This does not mean every Principle is wrong. Within the declared scope, REQU-005, REQU-034, REQU-022, and REQU-023 are boundedly supported; REQU-004 is supportable with an explicit graph boundary. The current Goal, `full sovereignty`, and the missing Principle class/precedence model are semantic blockers. Eight claims remain `insufficient basis` because their direct governing pages or downstream project dependencies were intentionally not inspected.

This verdict is a read-only review finding, not project assurance, a release gate, or authority to modify the carriers.

Stop here. Return after one of these changes: the Goal is bounded; sovereignty is narrowed; Principle classification/precedence is accepted; the Definition is admitted; the target is committed; or a follow-up audit opens the exact missing pages listed above.

## Open questions (confidence <95%)

### What should replace the current universal Goal wording?

Best current answer: preserve the ambition but bind it to a declared operator, feasible system class, available resources, observable working condition, and excluded legal/safety cases. **Confidence: 92%.** Missing input: the operator's intended meaning of `any operator`, `feasible`, and `working system`. Consequence: without this decision, Goal success remains non-refutable and cannot govern a compact Definition. Exact next action: state those three meanings in plain language before revising any Atom.

### Should CAPRMEDIO adopt FPF's five Principle classes and default precedence?

Best current answer: CAPRMEDIO needs explicit conflict classification and precedence, but it may adopt a smaller local scheme rather than copying FPF's labels. **Confidence: 93%.** Missing evidence: the uninspected CAPRMEDIO conflict-governance rules and the operator's desired conflict policy. Consequence: direct adoption could add unnecessary machinery; no policy leaves Principle conflicts subjective. Exact next action: compare the current conflict Requirements against E.3 and decide whether they supply an equivalent deterministic result.

### Does `operator sovereignty` mean ownership of project sources or unlimited decision authority?

Best current answer: it probably means full access to and control over project-owned sources, with external obligations still binding. **Confidence: 92%.** Missing input: explicit treatment of law, contracts, shared projects, safety/privacy, and external authority. Consequence: retaining `full sovereignty` without a boundary conflicts with the reviewed precedence and oversight model. Exact next action: define the operator's authority boundary before keeping this at Principle tier.

### Does the graph represent project truth or constitute it?

Best current answer: the graph is intended to be the working authority model, but direct relations and evidence must be established by their own governors before the graph represents them. **Confidence: 92%.** Missing input: an explicit CAPRMEDIO statement separating graph membership from truth, work occurrence, evidence sufficiency, and relation occurrence. Consequence: the Definition phrase `one typed graph` can otherwise imply that an edge makes a claim true. Exact next action: decide and record this boundary before Definition drafting.

### Are the source-limited Principles directionally compatible with FPF?

Best current answer: MECE, DRY, extensibility, configurability, discipline independence, replaceable substrates, and outcome-driven improvement appear directionally compatible, but direct support was not established. **Confidence: 90–94% depending on the claim.** Missing evidence: A.7, A.6.0, A.6.1, E.5.3, A.8, E.5.2, F.8, and E.23 plus the corresponding CAPRMEDIO Core dependencies. Consequence: promoting these rows to supported now would exceed the six-page budget and hide real boundaries. Exact next action: run one follow-up audit limited to these eight claims and sources.
