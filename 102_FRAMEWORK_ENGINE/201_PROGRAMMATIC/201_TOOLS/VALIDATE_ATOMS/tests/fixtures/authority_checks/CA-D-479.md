# Summary

Use stable headings for Atom body Properties

## Scope

structured Main Content of Markdown Atom Carriers for **all** Content Roles.

## Claim

a Markdown Atom's Main Content **must** carry its body Properties under the following exact headings **in** the listed order, **after** **`=1`** literal `# Summary` heading with the Summary value below it:

| Content Role | Required level-two headings, **in** order |
|---|---|
| Requirement, Method, Evaluation, Delivery | `## Scope`, `## Claim`, `## Details` |
| Analysis | `## Question`, `## Scope`, `## Approach`, `## Results`, `## TLDR` |
| Concern | `## Concern`, `## Evidences`, `## Blast radius` |
| Plan | `## Objective`, `## Details` |
| Operations | `## Operation`, `## Details` |

- carry **`=1`** occurrence of **every** listed heading for the Atom's Content Role. the primary content block is Claim for RMED, Question for Analysis, Concern for Concern, Objective for Plan, **and** Operation for Operations; position alone does **not** identify it; do **not** add a duplicate `## Claim` section **when** another heading is registered for that role.
- RMED Scope carries the Claim's applicability under CA-D-495. it precedes Claim, but is **not** a replacement for Claim **or** the source of Summary by itself.
- carry a Property **only** **in** its registered section, **not** again **in** frontmatter. use CA-D-470 for the Plan Definition of Done inside Details.
- a Property's section ends at the next heading of the same **or** a higher level, **or** at end of Main Content. supporting headings use lower levels; a separately registered nested Property remains independently addressable **without** copying its value.
- heading markers inside fenced code examples are content, **not** Property boundaries.
- do **not** infer a missing, renamed, duplicated, **or** ambiguously nested Property heading from prose, synonyms, **or** position alone.
- a Details section **may** be empty **when** no supporting content **or** required nested Property applies. this does **not** waive the Plan Definition of Done.
