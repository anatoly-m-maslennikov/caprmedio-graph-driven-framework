# Summary

Define Pre-runtime-resolved Relation Derivation

## Scope

identified deterministic derivations that establish represented Realization Graph Relations from selected source, build, configuration, **and** relevant environment inputs **without** executing represented behavior.

## Claim

Pre-runtime-resolved Relation Derivation **means** that an identified deterministic derivation establishes a represented Realization Graph Relation from the selected source, build, configuration, **and** relevant environment inputs **without** executing the represented behavior.

Pre-runtime-resolved Relation Derivation **must** identify the derivation **and** exact relevant inputs sufficiently **to** reproduce that resolution. Pre-runtime-resolved Relation Derivation applies **only** within those inputs **and** assumptions; it does **not** claim an observed runtime occurrence **or** a universally correct implementation.
