# Summary
Reconcile Development Backlog candidates **after** release

## Scope
Development Backlog candidates **after** a Release Record is accepted.

## Claim

CAPRMEDIO **must** reconcile the Development Backlog against its exact released manifest as follows:

- remove a candidate whose promoted Atoms were fully delivered **in** that release.
- **every** candidate that is unfinished, partially delivered, excluded, **or** newly deferred **must** remain unscheduled **or** move **to** another target version.
- a candidate **must not** be removed as shipped **unless** the released manifest accounts for its promoted Atoms.
