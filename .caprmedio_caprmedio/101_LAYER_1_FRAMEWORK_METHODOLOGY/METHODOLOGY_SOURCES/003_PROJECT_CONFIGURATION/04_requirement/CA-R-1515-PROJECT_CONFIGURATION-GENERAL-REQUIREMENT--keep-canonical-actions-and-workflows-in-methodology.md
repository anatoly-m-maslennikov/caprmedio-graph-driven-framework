# Summary

Keep canonical Actions and Workflows in methodology

## Scope

the canonical O definitions of Actions and Workflows used by TOOLS in the caprmedio Project.

## Claim

**in** the caprmedio Project, the canonical O definitions of Actions **and** Workflows used by TOOLS **must** belong **to** methodology source Scope Units.

## Details

- a Tool references the applicable canonical definition rather than independently defining the same Action **or** Workflow **in** its own Scope Unit.
- the owning methodology source **may** be Core Meta-Model, an admitted Extension, **or** Project Configuration according **to** the definition's actual applicability; this allocation rule does **not** make project-specific behavior universal Core authority.
- Implementation code **and** prompts **may** realize the definition **without** becoming another independently maintained operational definition.
