# Summary

Define Relation Derivation Class

## Scope

represented Realization Graph Relations and their derivation evidence.

## Claim

Relation Derivation Class **means** a classification of how a represented Realization Graph Relation is supported by source declarations, deterministic resolution, possible inference, **or** recorded observation.

## Details

it classifies the derivation evidence, **not** the Relation's validity **or** governing authority. multiple supported classes **may** apply **to** the same Relation; their evidence boundaries remain distinguishable.
