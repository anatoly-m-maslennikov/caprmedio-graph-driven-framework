# Summary

Register generated-data stages

## Scope

the ordered generated-data pipeline stages.

## Claim

the following ordered generated-data pipeline stages **must** be registered, referenced by their Carrier prefixes governed by CA-D-388-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-ENG_DECISION--serialize-generated-data-stage-prefixes-and-formats:

| Stage reference | Stage meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `src` | canonical Journal input; authority comes from the Journal, **not** the prefix. |
| `stg` | deterministic, lossless Projection of a bounded `src` frontier. |
| `mrt` | consumer-ready semantic Projection, including Requirement groupings by scope **and** tier **or** Mermaid relation maps. |
| `biz` | aggregated CAPRMEDIO artifact **and** implementation metrics, including point-in-time snapshots **and** historical trends. |

dependencies **must** move forward through `src → stg → mrt → biz`; a stage **may** depend on **any** earlier registered stage but **must not** depend on a later stage.
