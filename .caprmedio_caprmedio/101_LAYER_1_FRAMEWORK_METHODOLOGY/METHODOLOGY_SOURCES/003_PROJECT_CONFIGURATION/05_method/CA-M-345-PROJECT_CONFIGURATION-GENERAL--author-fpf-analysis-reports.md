# Summary

Author FPF Analysis Reports

## Scope

authoring and content-preserving import of FPF Analysis Report Atoms.

## Claim

**to** author an FPF Analysis Report, use the common Analysis structure under CA-D-479 and retain the report's bounded question, scope, approach, results, provenance and evidence limits without treating its recommendations as accepted specification.

- carry `content_role: Analysis` and `type: FPF Analysis Report`, the actual owning Scope Unit, applicable tier, Author, Status and Revision Properties. Summary describes the Question; TLDR summarizes the retained analytical record without replacing Results.
- **when** importing an existing report, preserve its complete original UTF-8 text as quoted Markdown in Results. Quotation is a carrier wrapper, not an edit to the original text. Record its original path, SHA-256 and byte length in Approach so the original bytes can be recovered and checked.
- identify the original inquiry from its explicit task or question where available; otherwise identify the bounded historical report without inventing a missing execution contract. Preserve all native findings, alternatives, citations, limitations and time-relative statements in the quoted record.
- distinguish import metadata and its current Revision timestamp from the original report's provenance. Do not infer an original execution timestamp or completed FPF Run merely from a filename or physical file existence.
- place the Carrier by the applicable Analysis Delivery rules. Resolve real destination links to the new Carrier while retaining historical Journal, archive and frozen-evidence references unchanged.

## Details

Importing a report does not rerun FPF, adopt a candidate, change project policy or close an issue. Completion of the bounded imported reporting product is distinct from those outcomes.
