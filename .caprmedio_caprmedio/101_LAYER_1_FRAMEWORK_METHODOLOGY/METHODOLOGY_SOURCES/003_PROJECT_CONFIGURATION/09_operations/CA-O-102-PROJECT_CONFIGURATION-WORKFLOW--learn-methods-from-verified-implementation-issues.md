# Summary

Learn Methods from verified implementation issues

## Operation

Method Learning Workflow **means** the separately invoked graph that derives **and**, **when** admitted, accepts Method lessons from verified implementation evidence.

- entry: CA-O-101.
- nodes: CA-O-101, CA-O-098.
- transitions use Workflow-scoped `ON_RESULT`; terminal results are **not** Steps.

| From Step | Result condition | Next Step **or** terminal result |
|---|---|---|
| CA-O-101 | drafted | CA-O-098 |
| CA-O-101 | already_covered | completed |
| CA-O-101 | blocked | blocked |
| CA-O-098 | accepted | completed |
| CA-O-098 | already_covered | completed |
| CA-O-098 | blocked | blocked |

the input is an explicitly admitted learning request with retained implementation issue, test, diagnosis, **and** fix evidence, **not** an automatic continuation required for implementation completion. a failed invocation, unknown result, stale evidence, **or** unmet confidence/permission gate terminates `blocked` with actual partial results. a blocked learning Run does **not** retroactively fail a verified implementation Run; a separately discovered implementation defect still requires its own disposition.
