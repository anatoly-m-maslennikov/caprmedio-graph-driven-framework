# Summary

Aggregate the full Release Gate

## Step

This Step invokes CA-O-183 once after CA-O-182, binding CA-O-174 closed-unit, CA-O-177 image-canary and CA-O-182 host Candidate E2E receipts to one exact candidate before CA-O-178 promotion.

## Details

It cannot promote or retire. Any unavailable, mismatched, stale, failed, partial or recording-blocked constituent stops the Workflow before promotion and preserves recovery evidence without implicit retry.
