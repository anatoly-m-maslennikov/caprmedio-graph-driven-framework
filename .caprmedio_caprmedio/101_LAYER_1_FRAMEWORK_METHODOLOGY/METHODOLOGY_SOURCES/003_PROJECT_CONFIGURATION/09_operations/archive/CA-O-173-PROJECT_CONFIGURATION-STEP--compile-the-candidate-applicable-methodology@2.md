# Summary

Compile the candidate Applicable Methodology

## Step

This Step invokes CA-O-166 once with phase `compile`, binding only the complete delivered source manifest from CA-O-172 and the reviewed selected-snapshot compiler Tool boundary. Its candidate output is only the sealed child materialization under `_release_materialized/<candidateSnapshotManifest.sha256>/`; the canonical `_projection/APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY` remains source-bound and is not this Step's output. A later derived runtime Methodology delivery is not compiler output authority.

## Details

This is not another compiler graph: CA-O-166 uses the reviewed Tool boundary required for a selected pinned snapshot while preserving the existing canonical compiler authority. A changed frontier, incomplete delivery, unbound Tool/layout, child-materialization mismatch, or any canonical projection mutation stops without runtime installation, image work or promotion.
