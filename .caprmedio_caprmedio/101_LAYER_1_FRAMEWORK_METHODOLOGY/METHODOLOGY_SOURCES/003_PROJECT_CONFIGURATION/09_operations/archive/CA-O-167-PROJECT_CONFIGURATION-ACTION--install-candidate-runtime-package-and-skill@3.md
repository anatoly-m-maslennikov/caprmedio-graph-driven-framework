# Summary

Stage candidate runtime package and Skill

## Action

Stage candidate runtime package and Skill **means** the Action that performs the one bound `stage_candidate` phase from the compiled, frozen N+1 candidate manifest without selecting N+1 as the active runtime or project Skill.

## Scope

`stage_candidate` prepares the complete declared candidate Framework package only under `.caprmedio_tmp/release_candidates/<run_id>/package/`, including its manifest, sealed Engine, sealed private candidate Methodology export with logical `methodology/` delivery mapping, complete `ca` Skill/default payload, dependency-lock identity and matching image context. It also stages CA-D-563's complete hook-free `ca` directory payload for eventual project-local target `.agents/skills/ca`, without replacing N's active project-local Skill or writing live root `methodology/`, `.caprmedio_install`, `.caprmedio_runtime` or an installed control tree.

## Details

The phase requires the exact compiled output, package manifest/digests, staging target identity, permissions and recovery boundary validated by CA-O-165. Preserve the active N runtime and Skill selection until CA-O-169 promotion, along with rollback evidence, Project and framework-instance settings, authoring sources, Journals and unrelated Skills. A missing Methodology member, unbound target, incomplete Skill directory, digest mismatch, hook, partial staging, unavailable permission or failed postcondition is blocked or partial with actual evidence. This Action does not infer a Skill target, install a global Skill, select candidate runtime/Skill, alter global settings, register MCP, test, build an image, promote, remove images or retry itself. Every actual invocation is journaled once.
