# Summary

Run the closed candidate Unit gate

## Step

This Step invokes CA-O-168 once with phase `closed_unit_gate`, binding CA-O-173's exact compiled candidate, frozen N/N+1, candidate manifest, source frontier and the declared Unit partition.

## Details

The Unit partition is complete for every declared testcase except exactly these three host Candidate E2E modules: `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/203_APPS/WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR/tests/test_docker_e2e.py`, `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/203_APPS/WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR/tests/test_selected_workflows_docker_e2e.py`, and `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/203_APPS/WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR/tests/test_selected_query_mcp_e2e.py`. Every declared Unit testcase must terminal-pass for this exact candidate; skipped, excluded, missing or zero-coverage testcase is non-pass. Its proof is the then-existing sealed Version/source/configuration/catalog/lock and compiled output; it does not require a later staged package or immutable image. Focused, cached, host-only or historical results are not substitutes. This Step cannot select N+1, stage packages, build or remove images, or retry.
