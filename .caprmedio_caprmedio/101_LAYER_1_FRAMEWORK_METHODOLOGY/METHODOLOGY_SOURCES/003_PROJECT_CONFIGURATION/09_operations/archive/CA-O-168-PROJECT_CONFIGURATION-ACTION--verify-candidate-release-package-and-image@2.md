# Summary

Verify candidate release package and image

## Action

Verify candidate release package and image **means** the Action that performs one bound `closed_unit_gate`, `candidate_image_build`, or `candidate_image_canary` phase for frozen N+1 without promoting it.

## Scope

`closed_unit_gate` runs only the closed declared unit gate from the compiled candidate boundary; it is not the host Candidate E2E or Full Gate. `candidate_image_build` builds one fresh candidate image from the exact staged candidate package, sources and declared build context and records its immutable digest. `candidate_image_canary` verifies that exact immutable image, complete staged package, matching compiled Methodology and hook-free Skill in the frozen container boundary. The frozen Docker worker receives no Docker socket: host-capable Candidate E2E is a separate explicit Action.

## Details

An old image, host mount, mutable tag, partial suite, cached result, source-only assertion, package manifest alone, build success alone or recursive Release Version invocation is not proof. Candidate testing, image construction and proof cannot alter N, select N+1 runtime/Skill, retire an image, switch this Run's definitions, use a live paid CLI or make an unbound external call. Failed, unsafe, unavailable or recording-blocked proof returns its actual outcome and preserves candidate evidence; it never reports N+1 promoted. Each actual Action Run, including a failed test or proof, is journaled once with its exact input and image/package digests.
