# Summary

Prepare tests in shared implementation context

## Operation

Evaluation Implementation Step **means** the Workflow node invoking **=1** Action, CA-O-018, **in** Integrated context under CA-R-1527.

- bind inputs from the selected P/Plan item, retained participating-session context, direct full `methods` rows, R/E/D, owned work boundary, current candidate **and** tests, **and** admitted prerequisites returned by CA-O-231. An optional legacy `method_projection` may accompany those rows but is not required.
- use the host's native session/subagent, file, **and** command capabilities; this binding has no MCP prerequisite. missing required context **or** capability returns a blocked invocation, **not** silent execution **in** another context.
- retain exact Action/Step Revisions, source bindings, actual effects, **and** returned results. pass the Action's result **to** the Workflow **without** independently copying its behavior.

Retain the participating session and complete source-bound work/evidence across these Integrated invocations. A replacement requires a complete retained handoff and fresh admission; conversational memory alone is not evidence.

- retain shared request/Plan, current source-bound R/M/E/D, exact candidate and actual prior results, findings, and remaining retry/resource state. This explicit Integrated binding does not alter the context of standalone review Steps.
