# Summary

Prevent duplicate production exception stack traces

## Scope

exceptions handled **or** escalated through production-relevant components’ Logging Policies.

## Claim

an exception is emitted once at the boundary responsible for handling **or** escalating it; lower layers preserve structured context **without** duplicating the same stack trace at **every** call boundary.

## Details

the exception boundary retains structured context for handling **or** escalation **without** repeating the same stack trace through lower layers.
