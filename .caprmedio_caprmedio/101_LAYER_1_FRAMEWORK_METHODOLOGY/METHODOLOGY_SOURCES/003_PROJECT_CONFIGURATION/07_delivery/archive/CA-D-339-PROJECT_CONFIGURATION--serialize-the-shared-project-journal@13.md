# Summary

Serialize the shared Project Journal

## Scope

shared Project Work Journal serialization.

## Claim

the shared Project Work Journal **must** materialize its logical event table by serializing its ordered event Records as append-only NDJSON File Carrier segments **in** its registered Project-wide Journal directory. these segments **must** remain Carriers of the same Journal, **not** separate Journals for Scope Units, Content Roles, workflows, **or** derived log views. describing the Journal as a table does **not** replace this registered serialization **or** require a database Carrier.
