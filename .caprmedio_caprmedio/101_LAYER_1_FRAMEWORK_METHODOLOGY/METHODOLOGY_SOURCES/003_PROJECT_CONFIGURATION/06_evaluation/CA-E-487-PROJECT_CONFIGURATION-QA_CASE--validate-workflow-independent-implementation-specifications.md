# Summary

Validate Workflow-independent Implementation specifications

## Scope

the Evaluation of a CAPRMEDIO implementation Spec.

## Claim

the Evaluation of a CAPRMEDIO implementation Spec **must** reject dependence on a production Workflow under CA-R-1514-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--keep-implementation-specifications-independent-of-production-workflows.

## Details

## Cases and expected results

- the same RMED is satisfied by Implementations produced with different Workflows **or** **without** a formally defined Workflow: neither production choice is a failure by itself.
- an ordinary implementation Requirement delegates a required behavior **to** an O definition outside the permitted exceptions: fail for incomplete RMED authority.
- an implementation Spec requires a particular production Workflow as the condition for conformity: fail for coupling the result **to** its production procedure.
- a Tool's RMED refers **to** the methodology Action it implements under CA-R-1516-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-REQUIREMENT--bind-each-tool-to-one-methodology-action **and** CA-R-1517-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-REQUIREMENT--keep-tool-operational-authority-outside-its-own-subtree: this permitted realization reference is **not** a production-Workflow dependency.
- a methodology Evaluation checks an Action **or** Workflow definition under CA-R-1518-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--separate-methodology-and-tool-evaluation-responsibilities: this permitted evaluation target is **not** a production-Workflow dependency.
- a generic executor consumes different applicable Workflow definitions as inputs while its RMED fully specifies their interpretation under CA-R-1519-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--require-conforming-workflow-execution: accept this boundary; reject an attempt **to** treat a particular production Workflow as necessary for executor conformity.
- changing a valid Workflow input changes the executed behavior **without** requiring a copied Workflow policy **in** the executor Spec: this is input interpretation, **not** incomplete implementation authority.

identify the exact Claim, reference, **and** violated boundary. incomplete evidence **must not** be reported as a pass.
