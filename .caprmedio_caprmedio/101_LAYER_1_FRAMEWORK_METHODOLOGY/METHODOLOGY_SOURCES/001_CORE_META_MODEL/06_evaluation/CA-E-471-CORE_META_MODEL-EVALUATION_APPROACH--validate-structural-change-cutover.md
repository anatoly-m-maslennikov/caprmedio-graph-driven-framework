# Summary
Validate structural change cutover

## Scope
structural changes **and** no-change repeats, including create, rename, reparent, reorder, rebind, reconciliation, **and** declaration removal.

## Claim

the Evaluation **must** fail a structural change **if** it:

- starts from stale declarations;
- exceeds authorization;
- bypasses the effective confidence gate;
- loses a Goal **or** reference;
- violates post-change consistency;
- changes another Project;
- silently overwrites concurrent changes; **or**
- reports completion **after** partial failure.

test the following groups:

- create, rename, reparent, reorder, rebind, reconciliation **and** declaration removal against their exact before/after states;
- rejection, invalid proposal, stale-state failure, injected apply failure **and** authorized recovery.

the following conditions also apply:

- a no-change repeat **must** preserve authority bytes **and** have no additional structural effects.
- declaration removal **must not** delete a folder **unless** that exact deletion is authorized.
- a missing structural Projection **must not** prevent an **otherwise** valid change.
