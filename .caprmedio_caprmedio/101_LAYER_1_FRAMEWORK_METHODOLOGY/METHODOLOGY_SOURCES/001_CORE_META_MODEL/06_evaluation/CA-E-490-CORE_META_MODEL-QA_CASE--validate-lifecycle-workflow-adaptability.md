# Summary

Validate lifecycle Workflow adaptability

## Scope

a status-change Workflow **and** its target Entity's applicable model.

## Claim

the Evaluation **must** check that a status-change Workflow follows the target Entity's applicable model under CA-R-1521.

## Details

- supply **`=2`** applicable status models with different admitted values, including a newly admitted value absent from the original model; the same Workflow definition **must** support their admitted transitions.
- specialize an Atom's model by Content Role **and** Type; checking **only** a universal Atom value list fails.
- supply an applicable Scope Unit **or** Atom Collection model; admit its valid change **without** imposing an Atom lifecycle.
- request an unknown value, a prohibited transition, **or** a change **without** a defined model: reject **without** inventing a value **or** bypassing required Carrier behavior.
- supply a model requiring an unsupported capability: require an explicit limitation rather than a false pass.

these cases validate the methodology definition; an executor requires separate Implementation checks.
