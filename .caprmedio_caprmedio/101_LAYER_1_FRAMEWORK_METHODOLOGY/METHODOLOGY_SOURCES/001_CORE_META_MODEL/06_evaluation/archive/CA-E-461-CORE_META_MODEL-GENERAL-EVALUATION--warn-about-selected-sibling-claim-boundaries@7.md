# Warn About Selected-sibling Claim Boundaries

**when** **`=1`** Atom Claim concerns **only** **`>=2`** selected sibling Scope Units **and** does **not** apply **to** their containing Scope Unit as a whole, the Evaluation **must** report a non-blocking boundary warning for review; that restriction alone **must not** make the Atom invalid **or** trigger automatic rejection, splitting, **or** retargeting **to** their parent.
