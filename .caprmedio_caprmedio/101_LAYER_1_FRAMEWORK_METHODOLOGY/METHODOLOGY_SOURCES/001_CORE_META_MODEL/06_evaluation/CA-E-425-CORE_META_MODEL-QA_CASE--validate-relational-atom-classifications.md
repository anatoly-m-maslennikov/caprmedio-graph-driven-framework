# Summary

Validate Relational Atom Classifications

## Scope

Relational Atom classifications.

## Claim

the Relational Atom classification Evaluation **must** enforce the qualified Types admitted by CA-R-924 **without** treating Plan Labels as Types.

- accept permitted relational Requirement/Goal, Requirement/Demand, **and** Plan/Plan cases with explicit non-default Claim targets.
- accept a current-scope Plan with decomposition **or** blocking **without** classifying it as relational merely because those Relations exist.
- change the Plan Label from Task **to** Objective **or** Epic; retain the same target-based classification.
- reject an unregistered qualified Type, an invalid relational target, **or** a Label interpreted as Type authority.

report the exact Atom, qualified Type, **and** target condition.
