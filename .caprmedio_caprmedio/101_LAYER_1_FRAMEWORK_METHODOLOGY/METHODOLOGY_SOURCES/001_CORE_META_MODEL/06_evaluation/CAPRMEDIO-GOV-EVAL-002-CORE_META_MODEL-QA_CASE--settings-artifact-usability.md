# Summary

Settings Artifact Usability

## Scope

the Operator has no undocumented Framework knowledge **and** **must not** edit the Framework Catalog.

## Claim

an Operator unfamiliar with the repository can configure framework-instance behavior, including default **and** Project Authority Modes, through Framework Instance Settings **and** Project initialization inputs through Project Settings using the owning Settings Artifacts **and** their in-file documentation, while recognizing authoritative Project Structure as the separate owner of Scope Unit declarations **and** explicit per-unit Authority Mode overrides. no structural Projection is required **to** make these choices.

## Details

### Acceptance criteria

**every** intended change is made through its owning Settings Artifact **or** Project Structure, **and** **`>=90`**% of classifications correctly distinguish project choices from methodology definitions.

### Failure disposition

record a Concern for **every** misleading **or** missing setting instruction **and** stop settings-usability readiness **until** it is corrected.
