# Summary
Validate Specification, Change, and Implementation classification

## Scope
classification of an Atom by its Content Role.

## Claim
the classification Evaluation **must** fail **if** an Atom's Content Role does **not** match its actual contribution under the Specification, Change, **and** Implementation definitions.

- use the evaluated Atom's declared Content Role, complete Main Content, **and** applicable Specification, Change, **and** Implementation definitions as the input evidence.
- compare the declared Content Role with the contribution expressed **in** that Main Content, using the following classification table.
- report unresolved **when** required evidence is unavailable, unresolved, **or** contradictory; **otherwise**, report pass **if** the declared Content Role matches the observed contribution **and** fail **if** it does **not**.
- identify the evaluated Atom **and** report the declared Content Role, relevant content excerpt, applicable definition, **and** comparison result.

| Claim contribution | Expected classification |
|---|---|
| a model definition, required property, **or** permission governing a Concern, Analysis, Task, Action, **or** Workflow | Requirement |
| a convention for authoring **or** constructing that content | Method |
| a falsifiable correctness check | Evaluation |
| a Carrier's fields, format, **or** placement | Delivery |
| a particular unresolved issue, analytical finding, **or** intended Task | the matching Concern, Analysis, **or** Plan role |
| a particular reusable Action behavior, Workflow graph, Step invocation binding, **or** Actor participation/authorization behavior | Operations |
| a current realization of accepted specification | Implementation |

reusing the specified content's role as the specification's role **must** fail this check. a long-lived Concern **or** reusable Workflow **must not** fail merely because its lifetime is long.
