# Summary

Resolve Active Atoms from Canonical Carrier Identities

## Scope

Active Atom Carrier discovery from selected Project-owned Markdown source frontiers.

## Claim

Active Atom Carrier discovery **must** resolve requested Atom IDs from the identities carried inside the selected Project-owned Markdown source frontier **and** select carried Status Active.

- validate the associated canonical addresses against those internal values under CA-D-480.
- report zero **or** multiple Active matches **and** missing **or** conflicting identity **or** Status; do **not** repair discovery by silently preferring a filename **or** directory.
- a non-Active containing Hub does **not** change the Status of a nested Atom.
