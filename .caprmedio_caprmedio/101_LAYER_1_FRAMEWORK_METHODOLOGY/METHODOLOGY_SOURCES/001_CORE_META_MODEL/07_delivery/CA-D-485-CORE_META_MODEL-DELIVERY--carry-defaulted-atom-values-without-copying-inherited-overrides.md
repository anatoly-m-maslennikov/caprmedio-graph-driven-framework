# Summary

Carry defaulted Atom values without copying inherited overrides

## Scope

defaulted Atom values and inherited external settings.

## Claim

a writer **must** preserve the distinction between a defaulted Atom Property **and** an inherited external setting:

- a required Atom value selected by applying a default is still carried at its canonical internal location; equality **to** that default does **not** permit omitting the value.
- an unselected optional override remains absent; do **not** copy an inherited effective setting into a locally selected override.
- retain an explicit override even **when** it currently equals the inherited value, because later upstream changes **must not** change that selection.
