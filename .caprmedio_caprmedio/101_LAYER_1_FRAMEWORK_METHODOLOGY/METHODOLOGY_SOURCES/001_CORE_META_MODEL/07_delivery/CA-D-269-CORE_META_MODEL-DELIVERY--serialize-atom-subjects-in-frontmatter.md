# Summary

Serialize Atom Subjects in Frontmatter

## Scope

New **or** migrated Markdown Atom Carriers.

## Claim

**every** new **or** migrated Markdown Atom Carrier **must** serialize its Subjects directly as **`=1`** scalar Subject Path at `subjects.governs` **and** an unordered collection of **`>=0`** unique scalar Subject Paths at `subjects.depends_on`; an absent dependency collection **means** zero dependencies. the `governs` **or** `depends_on` key encodes the Subject Relation Kind; the source Atom is implicit **and** the scalar value encodes its target's Subject Path, **not** the Subject Relation itself. these values resolve their canonical targets under CA-R-1202-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--resolve-every-direct-subject-target-once **without** an intermediate Subject/Entity **or** Subject/Reference field **or** a repeated target-kind field.

## Details

an existing unmigrated Carrier **may** temporarily retain `subjects.<governs|depends_on>.<continuant|occurrent>` **only** **until** its explicitly assigned carrier-migration Task is executed. this compatibility is migration-limited, preserves the same direct relation facts **and** target identities, **and** does **not** establish a second canonical representation. legacy temporal-classification authority **and** bulk Carrier conversion require their separately assigned migration Tasks.
