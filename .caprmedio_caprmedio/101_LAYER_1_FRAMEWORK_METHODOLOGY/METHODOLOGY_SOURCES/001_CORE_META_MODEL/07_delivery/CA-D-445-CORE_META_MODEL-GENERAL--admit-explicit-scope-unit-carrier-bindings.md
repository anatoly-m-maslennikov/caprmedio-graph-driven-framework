# Summary

Admit explicit Scope Unit Carrier bindings

## Scope

explicit Scope Unit authority and Implementation Folder bindings in Project Structure.

## Claim

an explicit Scope Unit authority **or** Implementation Folder binding **in** Project Structure **may** select a native directory layout instead of the default Scope Unit directory convention. the binding **must** remain unambiguous, inside authorized path boundaries, distinct from another unit's exact authority binding, **and** explicit about its owning unit. a selected native layout **must not** change declared parentage, Structural Level, Type, Local Order, **or** Name merely because its path has different nesting **or** numeric tokens. ordinary physical containment remains observable **without** becoming a second declaration of structural parentage.
