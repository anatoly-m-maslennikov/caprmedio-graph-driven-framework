# Serialize Authored Direct Relations on Their Owning Atoms

**every** authored direct semantic relation **must** be serialized once under `relations.<RELATION_KIND>` on the Atom that owns its declared direction as a nonempty unordered collection of unique canonical target references **in** deterministic canonical order; target position **must not** add, remove, **or** alter a direct relation **or** dependency.
