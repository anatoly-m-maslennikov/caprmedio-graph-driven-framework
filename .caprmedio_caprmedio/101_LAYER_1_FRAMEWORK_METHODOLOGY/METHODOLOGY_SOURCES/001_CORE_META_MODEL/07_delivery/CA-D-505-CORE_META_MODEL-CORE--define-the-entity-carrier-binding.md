# Summary

Define the Entity Carrier binding

## Scope

Carrier bindings of Entities.

## Claim

the Carrier Property of an Entity **means** its binding **to** the Carrier that stores **or** represents it.

## Details

- write this Property as `(Entity)/Carrier`, using the actual Entity path, such as `Atom/Carrier` **or** `Scope Unit/Carrier`.
- the binding follows IS_CARRIED_BY.
- the Property refers **to** a Carrier; the referenced Carrier remains a Primary Entity.
