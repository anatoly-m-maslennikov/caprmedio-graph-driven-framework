# Summary

Place Project-Owned Persistent Carriers

## Scope

persistent Carriers of Project governing Artifacts and project-control evidence.

## Claim

**every** governed Project **must** place its governing Artifacts **and** project-control evidence under `.caprmedio_<project_name>/`, **where** `<project_name>` is that Project's exact lowercase name.

## Details

Project-control Journal File Carriers use _journal and persistent view Projections use _projection under this root. Native Implementation follows its own governed Delivery location. Runtime technical and business Journal Carriers may instead use explicitly configured local databases, remote databases, or logging sinks; their Journal classification does not force their physical storage into the Project-control root.
