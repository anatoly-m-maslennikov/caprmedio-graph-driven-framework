# Summary

Retain recovered source-verifier assumptions

## Concern

Two disposable source completion checks used overly specific incorrect assertions, although the saved carriers did not have those claimed defects.

## Evidences

P1445 assumed fourteen transition rows instead of deriving thirteen from the preserved seven explicit rows plus six wildcard expansions. P1444 expected a literal disclaimer rather than its saved equivalent wording. Both stopped honestly, corrected only the check assumption, and reran the bounded saved gate; source/output meaning was not altered to satisfy a verifier.

## Blast radius

These acquisition/verification incidents remain retained in the owned Plan evidence; they are not runtime failures or evidence of source acceptance. Use actual original structure and semantic disclaimers in the corrected gate. No broad verifier rewrite campaign is required.
