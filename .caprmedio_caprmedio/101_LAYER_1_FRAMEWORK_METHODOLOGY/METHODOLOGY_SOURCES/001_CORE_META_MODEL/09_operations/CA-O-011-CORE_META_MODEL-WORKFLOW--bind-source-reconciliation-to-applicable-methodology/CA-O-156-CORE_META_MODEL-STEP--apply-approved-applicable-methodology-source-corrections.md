# Summary

Apply approved Applicable Methodology source corrections

## Operation

this Step is the correct node **of** CA-O-011, Applicable Methodology Compilation, invoking **`=1`** Action, CA-O-008, Apply Approved Source Corrections.

### Inputs and parameters

bind the exact approved correction and recorded decision from CA-O-155, their selected frontier, and the Workflow Run's current source state and separately authorized owning-source change workflow.

require the separately authorized source change workflow; corrections are **not** compiler side effects **or** edits **to** projected Claims. **if** **any** source changes, the Workflow Run returns **to** select **and** repeats assessment against the new frontier. failure **or** partial effects never justify publishing from the earlier assessment.

### Agentic invocation binding

for an invocation whose actual bound Action is Agentic, bind **`=1`** Integrated **or** Isolated context under CA-R-1527 from the admitted invocation's supplied `agentic_execution_context` runtime parameter **before** dispatch. missing, ambiguous **or** unsupported values, **or** unavailable required context/capability, block that Agentic invocation; do **not** default **or** silently substitute. retain the selected context with the Step Run. a Programmatic invocation does **not** acquire an Agent context **or** require this parameter. this binding grants no additional authority **and** does **not** change the Action's identity **or** behavior.
