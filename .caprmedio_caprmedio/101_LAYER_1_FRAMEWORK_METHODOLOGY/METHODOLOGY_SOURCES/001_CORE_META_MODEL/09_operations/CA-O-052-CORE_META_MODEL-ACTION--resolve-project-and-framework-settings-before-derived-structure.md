# Summary

Resolve Project and Framework Settings before derived structure

## Operation

Resolve Project Initialization Inputs **means** the reusable Action that resolves the current Project's authoritative initialization inputs **before** interpreting its Project Structure **or** deriving structural values from it.

1. resolve the current Project's Project Settings through its registered authoritative Carrier under CA-D-366.
2. resolve that Project's effective Framework Instance Settings parameters according **to** CA-M-279.
3. use these resolved inputs **before** interpreting authoritative Project Structure **or** deriving structural values from it.

this Action **must not** require an existing Project Atom **or** Implementation **to** resolve initialization inputs, substitute a Projection for either Settings Artifact, **or** read another Project's instance settings. unresolved required parameters follow CA-M-279's stop condition. the Action reuses the registered Settings Carriers; it does **not** define their format **or** placement independently.
