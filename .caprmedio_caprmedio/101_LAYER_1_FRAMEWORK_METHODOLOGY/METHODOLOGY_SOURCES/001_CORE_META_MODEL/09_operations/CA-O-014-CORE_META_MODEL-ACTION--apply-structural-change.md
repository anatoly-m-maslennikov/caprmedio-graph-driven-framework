# Summary

Apply structural change

## Operation

Apply Structural Change **means** the Action that rechecks the authorized proposal against the unchanged selected source state **and** applies its accepted declarations, reference repairs, **and** explicitly included Carrier changes through one recoverable cutover. **if** the source state differs, required validation fails, **or** permission no longer covers the effects, it **must** stop **before** mutation. **if** a partial failure occurs, it **must** report the actual effects **and** use **only** the authorized recovery boundary; it **must not** delete unapproved contents, overwrite concurrent edits, reset the retry budget, **or** claim a completed migration. event evidence follows the applicable Journal model, **not** a second structural authority.
