# Summary

Bind source reconciliation to Applicable Methodology

## Operation

Applicable Methodology Compilation **must** bind Source Reconciliation **to** producing Applicable Methodology by reusing CA-O-010's control-flow pattern **and** shared Action definitions with its own Workflow-owned Step Atoms below. this preserves the named methodology-specific Workflow target; it does **not** introduce a Step that invokes another Workflow **or** duplicate an Action definition.

the entry Step is CA-O-152. interpret Step bindings **and** run boundaries under CA-R-1509, CA-R-1510, **and** CA-R-1511. these Steps belong **only** **to** this Workflow, CA-O-011; they do **not** share the Step identities owned by CA-O-010. their referenced Actions remain shared authority, and their exact Applicable Methodology parameters **and** input sources are carried by the respective Step Atoms.

### Steps

| Workflow-owned Step |
|---|
| CA-O-152 |
| CA-O-153 |
| CA-O-154 |
| CA-O-155 |
| CA-O-156 |
| CA-O-157 |

### Transitions

the transitions below use the Workflow-scoped ON_RESULT Relation under CA-R-1513 **when** the destination is a Step. a terminal outcome ends the Workflow Run; it is **not** another Step **or** Action.

| Step | Result condition | Next Step **or** outcome |
|---|---|---|
| CA-O-152 | complete exact selection | CA-O-153 |
| CA-O-152 | incomplete, ambiguous, **or** failed selection | stop **and** escalate; no publication |
| CA-O-153 | required checks complete, no unresolved conflict, required approvals valid | CA-O-157 |
| CA-O-153 | unresolved conflict with an authorized correction-proposal route | CA-O-154 |
| CA-O-153 | incomplete checks, unavailable correction authority, **or** unsupported resolution | stop **and** escalate; no publication |
| CA-O-154 | exact supported proposal ready | CA-O-155 |
| CA-O-154 | unsupported proposal **or** unmet confidence/authority gate | stop **and** escalate; no source mutation **or** publication |
| CA-O-155 | valid exact approval **and** upstream corrections required | CA-O-156 |
| CA-O-155 | valid exact resolution decision **without** a needed source correction | CA-O-152, **then** reassess the decision against the selected frontier |
| CA-O-155 | requested revision **and** applicable authority permits another bounded proposal attempt | CA-O-154 |
| CA-O-155 | rejection, absent decision, invalid approval, **or** no accepted further attempt | stop **and** escalate; no source mutation **or** publication |
| CA-O-156 | authorized correction completed | CA-O-152, **then** reassess the new frontier |
| CA-O-156 | failed **or** partially completed correction | stop **and** escalate with actual effects; an expressly authorized bounded recovery re-enters at CA-O-152 |
| CA-O-157 | completed publication from the still-valid final frontier | complete |
| CA-O-157 | changed frontier | CA-O-152 **only** under the applicable accepted revisit conditions; **otherwise** stop **and** escalate |
| CA-O-157 | failed publication | stop **and** escalate under applicable recovery authority; do **not** report completion |

an AI Agent **must** resolve **and** satisfy its effective applicable Autonomous Confidence Threshold from governing sources **and** valid overrides, together with authorization gates, **before** continuing autonomously. this does **not** require a persisted Task Atom; unmet **or** unresolved gates require Operator clarification **or** escalation. **every** autonomous revisit, including re-evaluation **after** an approved source change, repeated correction proposals, **and** recovery retries, **must** remain within the applicable accepted retry budget **and** escalation conditions for the current Workflow Run. reselection **or** discovery of a new conflict does **not** reset that budget. an absent, exhausted, **or** unresolved revisit allowance requires stopping **and** escalation; required re-evaluation **must not** be skipped **to** publish. this Workflow does **not** authorize concurrent execution, arbitrary recursion, automatic source corrections, **or** publication with unresolved conflicts. execution evidence remains distinct from this reusable definition.
