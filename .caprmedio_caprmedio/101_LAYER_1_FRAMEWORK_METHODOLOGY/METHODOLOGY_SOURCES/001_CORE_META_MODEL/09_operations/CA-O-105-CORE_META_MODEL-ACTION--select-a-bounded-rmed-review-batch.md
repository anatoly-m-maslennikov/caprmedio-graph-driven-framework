# Summary

Select a bounded RMED review batch

## Operation

Select RMED Review Batch **means** the read-only Action that resolves a requested selection into a bounded, reproducible local-review queue.

1. resolve the requested Scope Unit locally **or** with descendants, Global **or** Local Tiers, **or** explicit Carrier list from carried Properties **and** authoritative selection data; select active RMED source Atoms.
2. gather the relevant `atom_local` rules once: CCE, local Property encoding **and** domains, body structure, **and** Scope/Claim/Details/Summary coherence. supply their actual content **and** the vocabulary needed for case checks.
3. record the original selection **in** the CA-D-496 progress list, ordered by Atom ID, Revision, **then** path. retain malformed **or** missing identifiers as inspectable candidates sorted by path.
4. return the full selected queue **and** shared rules **to** the caller: `ready`, `empty` for a genuinely empty selection, **or** `blocked` for unresolved selection.

## Details

the caller handles reviewer dispatch **after** gathering finishes, resolves context headroom under CA-D-497, **and** supplies **`=1`** Atom per fresh reviewer with its full text **and** relevant rules. the caller **must** keep the configured headroom unused **and** distinguish observed runtime usage from estimated workload. the batch is a scheduling unit, **not** a multi-Atom reviewer context. keep shared rules once **without** copying the full methodology into **every** report. the caller supplies permissions **and** a temporary output directory. unavailable data blocks **only** an in-scope selection **or** check; excluded graph checks do **not** become coverage gaps.
