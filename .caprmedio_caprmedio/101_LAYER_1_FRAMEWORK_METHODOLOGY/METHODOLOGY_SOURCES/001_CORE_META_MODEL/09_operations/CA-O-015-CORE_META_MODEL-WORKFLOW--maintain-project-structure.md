# Summary

Maintain Project Structure

## Operation

Project Structure Maintenance **means** the Workflow that maintains authoritative declarations through the following Step graph; Tools execute this Workflow **without** becoming its authority.

the entry Step is CA-O-139. interpret Step bindings **and** run boundaries under CA-R-1509, CA-R-1510, **and** CA-R-1511.

### Steps

| Step |
|---|
| CA-O-139 |
| CA-O-140 |
| CA-O-141 |
| CA-O-142 |
| CA-O-143 |
| CA-O-144 |

### Transitions

the transitions below use the Workflow-scoped ON_RESULT Relation under CA-R-1513 **when** the destination is a Step. a terminal outcome ends the Workflow Run; it is **not** another Step **or** Action.

| Step | Result condition | Next Step **or** outcome |
|---|---|---|
| CA-O-139 | exact current Project Structure, relevant Settings, Goal/Atom references **and** separate Carrier observations selected | CA-O-140 |
| CA-O-140 | bounded proposal ready | CA-O-141 |
| CA-O-141 | candidate conforms **and** required checks complete | CA-O-142 |
| CA-O-141 | contradiction, incomplete check, **or** unresolved disposition | stop; request a corrected proposal **or** Operator decision |
| CA-O-142 | authorization valid for exact effects **and** current state | CA-O-143 |
| CA-O-143 | cutover completed | CA-O-144 |
| CA-O-144 | required checks complete **and** accepted effects verified | complete |
| CA-O-139 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |
| CA-O-140 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |
| CA-O-141 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |
| CA-O-142 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |
| CA-O-143 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |
| CA-O-144 | failed, stale, ambiguous, unauthorized, **or** below-threshold outcome | stop **and** report the exact state; further attempts require applicable authorization **and** remaining retry allowance |

this Workflow produces authoritative source changes **and** validation results; it does **not** require **or** publish a separate Project Structure Projection. publication of an unrelated Projection remains a separately selected operation.
