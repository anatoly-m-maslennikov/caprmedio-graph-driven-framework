# Summary

Repair the evaluated RMED review batch

## Operation

RMED Review Repair Step **means** the Workflow node invoking **`=1`** Action, CA-O-111, **in** Isolated context.

- bind the local check report, current source, correction boundary, confidence/retry policy, **and** context budget.
- apply confirmed corrections **and** record them **in** the same report. return `fixed_not_rechecked` **only** **when** **all** initial checks concluded **and** no unresolved findings remain. safe partial fixes retain `blocked` **when** coverage **or** findings remain unresolved; this Step has no proposal review **or** saved-Atom recheck.
- retain the caller's Run ID on correction records **and** handoffs; return actual edits, rejected findings, **and** unresolved work for its full report **and** shared Journal recording under CA-O-104-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--review-and-repair-a-bounded-rmed-atom-batch.
- preserve Entity **and** relation targets; route required identity-changing **or** cross-Atom work as a blocked proposal for separate authorization.
- at the context threshold, save completed edits **and** unfinished work for a fresh subagent; resume **only** unfinished work.

## Details

the Step passes results **to** the caller **and** does **not** expand the local-review mutation boundary. native file **and** session capabilities are sufficient.
