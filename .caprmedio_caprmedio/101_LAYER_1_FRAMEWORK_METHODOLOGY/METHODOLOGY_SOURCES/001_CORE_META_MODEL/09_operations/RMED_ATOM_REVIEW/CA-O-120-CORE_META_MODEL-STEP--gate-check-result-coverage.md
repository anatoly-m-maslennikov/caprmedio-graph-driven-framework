# Summary

Gate check result coverage

## Operation

the check Coverage Gate substep **must** invoke **`=1`** Action, CA-O-118, with stage=check **after** the main check Step **and** **before** continuation.

## Details

- inputs: frozen selection, saved Step results, required coverage obligations **and** shared Run evidence.
- covered permits continuation; ask_operator interrupts with the saved missing-work question.
- retain the existing Run ID **and** Journal; do **not** dispatch another Atom reviewer **or** replay completed effects.
