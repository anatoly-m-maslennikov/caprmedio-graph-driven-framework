# Summary

Implement Requirements

## Claim

Requirement Implementation **means** the Agentic Action that realizes the selected P/Plan item's applicable Requirements after their tests are prepared, applying **all** governing Methods within Delivery boundaries.

- inputs: the assigned bounded Plan item, active Method Projection, selected R/E/D, current candidate, prepared tests **and** available baseline results, admitted prerequisites, **and** owned files/work boundary.
- implement **only** the selected ready work. preserve unrelated edits; do **not** alter expected test behavior **or** governing Atoms merely **to** obtain a pass.
- preparation of tests precedes the behavior they check; runnable baseline tests precede that behavior. an explicitly necessary test-execution prerequisite is limited **to** that prerequisite **and** remains traceable.
- return `implemented` with actual changes, fulfilled work, candidate identity **and** pending checks, **or** `blocked` with the exact cause. an unresolved Method conflict requires authority disposition; Atom ID **must not** select the winning Method. implementation is **not** proof of passing Evaluations.
