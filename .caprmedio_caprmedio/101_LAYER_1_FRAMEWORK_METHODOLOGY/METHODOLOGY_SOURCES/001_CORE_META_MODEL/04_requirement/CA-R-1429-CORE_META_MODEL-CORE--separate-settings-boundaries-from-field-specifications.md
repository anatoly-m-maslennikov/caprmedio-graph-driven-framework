# Summary

Separate settings boundaries from field specifications

## Scope

the authority boundary between settings foundations, shared settings specifications, **and** concrete specifications.

## Claim

- the Core-tier Atoms for Project Settings, Framework Instance Settings, **and** Default Settings **must** define their purpose, content, **and** authority boundaries;
- an independently governable shared settings specification **must** belong **to** General **when** General is admitted **in** its current Scope Unit **and** it preserves those foundations **without** selecting a concrete representation;
- **every** concrete section, field, **or** Carrier syntax specification **must** belong **to** Standard.

a setting **must not** require a General Atom **unless** a distinct shared specification requires independent authority.
