# Summary

Requirement — Create Rationale **after** its subject

## Scope

Rationale Atoms and their pre-existing specification subjects.

## Claim

a Rationale is an Analysis Atom created **only** **after** **every** specification Atom it explains already exists. the Rationale stores the directed relation **to** its subjects; specification Atoms contain **none** of (embedded Rationale, persisted Rationale backlink).

Rationale is explanatory rather than normative. Changing an obligation, boundary, Method, Evaluation condition, Delivery rule, **or** acceptance meaning requires a new applicable specification Atom rather than a Rationale.

## Primary claim

a Rationale follows **and** points **to** its pre-existing specification subjects **without** modifying them.
