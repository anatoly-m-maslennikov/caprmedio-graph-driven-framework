# Summary

Define Reconciled Projection

## Scope

the Reconciled Projection Type value under Projection.

## Claim

Reconciled Projection **means** the Type value under Projection whose instances preserve selected source content, canonical identities, **and** exact final selected Revisions **without** synthesis **or** merge, **and** have no unresolved source conflict under the applicable declared checks.

## Details

source selection **and** conflict resolution remain governed by applicable source authority. **any** needed source correction **must** be separately authorized by the Operator **and** applied upstream **to** that authority, **not** by editing the projected content **or** treating projection production as authorization **to** change a source. a result **must not** be published as a Reconciled Projection **until** its final selected source Revisions have been re-evaluated **after** **any** such correction **and** no conflict remains unresolved under those checks. this classification does **not** grant the result independent source authority **or** determine its Carrier materialization strategy.
