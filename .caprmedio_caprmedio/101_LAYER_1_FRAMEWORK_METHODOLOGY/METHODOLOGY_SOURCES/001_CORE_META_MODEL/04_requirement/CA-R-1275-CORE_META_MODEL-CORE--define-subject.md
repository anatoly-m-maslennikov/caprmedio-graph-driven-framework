# Summary

Define Subject

## Scope

Subjects relating an Atom and an Entity.

## Claim

a Subject **means** a direct Relation between an Atom **and** an Entity, typed as GOVERNS **or** DEPENDS_ON.

## Details

- the Atom is the source; the Entity is the target identified by its full canonical Subject Path.
- the Subject is the Relation, **not** its target, its target's path, **or** a Term used **in** that path.
- the Relation creates no intermediate Subject object **and** no additional target identity; it does **not** make the target bearer-dependent on the source Atom.
