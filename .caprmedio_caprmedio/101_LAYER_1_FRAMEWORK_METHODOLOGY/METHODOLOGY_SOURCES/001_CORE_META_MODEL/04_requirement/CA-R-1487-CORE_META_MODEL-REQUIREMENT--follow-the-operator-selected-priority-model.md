# Summary

Follow the Operator-selected priority model

## Scope

priority-model selection by the CAPRMEDIO Framework Instance for an affected Scope and Project stage.

## Claim

the CAPRMEDIO Framework Instance **must** support the admissible priority model established by the Operator for the affected Scope **and** Project stage. **every** resulting alternative selection **must** satisfy **all** of the following:

- respect applicable authority **and** non-negotiable constraints.
- conform **to** that model, its effective parameters, **and** its active criteria **without** substituting another comparison algorithm.
- remain unresolved **if** the selected model **or** its application does **not** justify a selection.

## Details

the available criteria **and** comparison techniques remain extensible; no fixed criterion set **or** comparison by priority order is mandatory.
