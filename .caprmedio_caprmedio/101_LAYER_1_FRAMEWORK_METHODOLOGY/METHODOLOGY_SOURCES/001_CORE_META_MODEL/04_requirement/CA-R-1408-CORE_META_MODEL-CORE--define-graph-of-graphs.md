# Summary

Define Graph of Graphs

## Scope

Graph of Graphs compositions and any generated overview Artifact.

## Claim

a Graph of Graphs **means** a composition of CAPRMEDIO Graphs connected through graph-qualified typed references **or** shared source identities. secondary graphs **in** this composition remain Projections under CA-R-1471-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--keep-secondary-graphs-derived-from-source-authority, **and** their internal, cross-graph, **and** authoritative-source connections remain governed by CA-R-1472-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--admit-typed-secondary-graph-connections.

the composition does **not**, by itself, require another separately generated overview Artifact. **if** an overview is generated, its represented connections remain derived from the participating graphs **and** their sources **without** becoming another authority.
