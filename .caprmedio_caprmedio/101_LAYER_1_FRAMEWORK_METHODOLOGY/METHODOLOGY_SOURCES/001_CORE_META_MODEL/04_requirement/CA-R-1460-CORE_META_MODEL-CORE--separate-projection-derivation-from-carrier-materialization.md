# Summary

Separate Projection derivation from Carrier materialization

## Scope

the derivation of a Projection and its Carrier materialization.

## Claim

the governing derivation logic of a Projection **must** remain distinct from its Carrier materialization strategy. whether **and** how its result is represented **or** persisted **in** Carriers does **not**, by itself, define the transformation **or** content-preservation behavior of that derivation, its semantic Type, **or** its refresh behavior; those remain determined by their applicable governing Claims. describing a derivation as direct **or** content-preserving does **not** select a persistence strategy.
