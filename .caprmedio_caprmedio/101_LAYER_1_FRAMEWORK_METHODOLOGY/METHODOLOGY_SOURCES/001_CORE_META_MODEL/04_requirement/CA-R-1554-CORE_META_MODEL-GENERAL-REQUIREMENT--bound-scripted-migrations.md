# Summary

Bound Scripted Migrations

## Scope

AI Agent participation in Scripted Migrations.

## Claim

an AI Agent that performs a Scripted Migration **must** satisfy **all** of these participation conditions:

- bind the migration **to** an exact governed Target Set;
- fail **when** an expected target is absent;
- produce a reviewable change set.

these conditions constrain the AI Agent's participation; they do **not** define the migration's Steps **or** Workflow control flow **or** grant additional mutation authority.
