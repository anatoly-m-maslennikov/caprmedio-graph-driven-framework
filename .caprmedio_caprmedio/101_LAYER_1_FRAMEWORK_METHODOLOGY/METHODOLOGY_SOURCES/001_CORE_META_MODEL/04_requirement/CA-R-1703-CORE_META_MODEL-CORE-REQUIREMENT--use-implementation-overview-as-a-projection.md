# Summary

Use Implementation Overview as a Projection

## Scope

Implementation Overview Projections.

## Claim

an Implementation Overview is a non-authoritative Projection of what the current normative Atom frontier, native project targets, available provenance, **and** **any** registered implementation lineage sources show as implemented. its Implementation Bindings derive from the shared Project Journal under CA-R-1695; the current view does **not** replace the historical implementation event records retained **in** that Journal. the Atom Content Role axis does **not** apply **to** this Projection.

it **may** report realization coverage, source-to-target bindings, relevant commits, **and** unresolved implementation gaps. it is regenerated mechanically **or** rebuilt through governed reasoning from its declared source frontier. it is never an Atom **and** cannot replace the Journal, normative Atoms, native implementation, Operations evidence, **or** Verification.

the presence of this Projection does **not** require an internal Implementation Atom. storage, retention, **and** whether the Projection is committed **or** generated at runtime remain governed separately.

## Primary claim

CAPRMEDIO represents the current view of project realization through an Implementation Overview Projection rather than an Implementation Atom.
