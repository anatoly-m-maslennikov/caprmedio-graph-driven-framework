# Summary

Define Owned Atoms

## Scope

the ownership of Atoms by Scope Units.

## Claim

Owned Atoms **means** the set of **all** Atoms whose internally carried current Scope Unit **`=`** the selected Scope Unit.

- a grouping Carrier, Plan decomposition, **or** physical placement does **not** replace that ownership value.
- a missing, invalid, **or** ambiguous ownership value leaves membership unresolved; do **not** derive it from the filename **or** containing folders.
- evaluate placement consistency separately **without** changing the selected Atom's declared ownership.
