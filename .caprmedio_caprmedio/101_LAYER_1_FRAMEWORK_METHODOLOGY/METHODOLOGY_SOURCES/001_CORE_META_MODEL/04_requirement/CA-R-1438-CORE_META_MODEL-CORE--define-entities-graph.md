# Summary

Define Entities Graph

## Scope

the Entities Graph Type value under Projection.

## Claim

Entities Graph **means** the Type value under Projection whose instances are derived CAPRMEDIO Graphs with native Entity nodes **and** edges representing Relations admitted for that graph kind by their governing authority. their represented facts retain their appropriate source authority under CA-R-1746.

admitted external graph **or** source references under CA-R-1472 do **not** become native Entity nodes merely by being referenced. those references retain their own endpoint classes **and** graph-qualified Relation authority.
