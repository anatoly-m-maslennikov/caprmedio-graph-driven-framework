# Summary

Define DEPENDS_ON Subject Relation Kind

## Scope

the DEPENDS_ON Subject Relation Kind of an Atom.

## Claim

DEPENDS_ON **means** the direct Subject Relation Kind from an Atom **to** a canonical Entity mentioned **in** its Markdown Main Content other than its GOVERNS target. this reference does **not** make the Claim authoritative about that Entity.

## Details

mentions **in** Summary, Scope, Claim, Details, other registered body sections, tables, **and** examples count. this Relation does **not** establish Workflow control flow **or** execution order; Plan start prerequisites remain separately governed by `BLOCKS` under CA-R-1580-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-plan-blocking.
