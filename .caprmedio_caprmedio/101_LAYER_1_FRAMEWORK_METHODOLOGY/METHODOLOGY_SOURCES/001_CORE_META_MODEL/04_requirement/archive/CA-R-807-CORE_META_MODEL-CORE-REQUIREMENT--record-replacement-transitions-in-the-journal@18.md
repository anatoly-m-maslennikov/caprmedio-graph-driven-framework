# Record replacement transitions in the Journal

replacement **or** absorption history **must** be recorded **only** **in** the authoritative Journal event that archives the predecessor. the authoritative Journal event that archives the predecessor **must** name the explicit predecessor Atom ID **and** **`>=1`** already active successor Atom IDs. active current-state Atom relations **must not** carry replacement history. formal `replaced_by` **and** `replacement_of` relation realization **must** remain deferred, **and** **any** later replacement navigation **must** be derived from immutable Journal **and** archive history under separately admitted authority.
