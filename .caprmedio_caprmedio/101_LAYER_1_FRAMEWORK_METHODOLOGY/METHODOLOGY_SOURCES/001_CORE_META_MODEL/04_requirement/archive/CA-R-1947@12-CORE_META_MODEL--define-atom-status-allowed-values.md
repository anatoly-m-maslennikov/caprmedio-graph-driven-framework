## Summary

Define Atom.Status allowed values

## Claim scope

The base allowed values inherited by narrower Atom kinds.

## Claim

Atom.Status **must** admit (Draft, Active, Archived). Narrower Atom kinds inherit these values and **may** add allowed values under their applicable Content Role or Type. An inherited value does **not** require a separate declaration for every narrower kind.

## Details

CA-R-1412 requires exactly one Status but does not declare the base allowed values. CA-R-1309 declares Draft, Active and Archived only for Requirements; it must not be retargeted to all Atoms as a Subjects-only change.
