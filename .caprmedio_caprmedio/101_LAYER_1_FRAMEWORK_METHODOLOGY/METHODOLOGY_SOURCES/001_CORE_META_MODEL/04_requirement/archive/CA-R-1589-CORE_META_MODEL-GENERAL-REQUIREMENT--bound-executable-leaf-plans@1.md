# Bound executable leaf Plans

**every** executable Plan with no direct decomposition **must** bound its own work **to** an estimate of **<=15** minutes for **=1** assigned AI Agent, with sufficient inputs, required output, verification, **and** no unresolved Operator decision; a composite Plan **may** have a larger roll-up estimate. the rule applies independently of Label.
