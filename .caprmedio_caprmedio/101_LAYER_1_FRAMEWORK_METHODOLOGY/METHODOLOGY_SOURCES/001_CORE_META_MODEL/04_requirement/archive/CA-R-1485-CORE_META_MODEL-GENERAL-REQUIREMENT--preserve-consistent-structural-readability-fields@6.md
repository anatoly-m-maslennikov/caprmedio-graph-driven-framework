# Summary

Preserve consistent structural readability fields

## Scope

derived structural readability representations retained by a Project Structure.

## Claim

Project Structure **may** retain derived structural representations for readability **only** **when** their authoritative inputs **and** consistency constraints are explicit. retained Structural Level **must** **`=`** declared parent depth from Project level **`0`**; a retained authority path **must** satisfy applicable Carrier naming **and** placement rules, including admitted exceptions. inconsistent representations **must** produce a reported conflict **without** an automatic choice of a new Name, parent, order, **or** binding. readability does **not** establish another source of authority.
