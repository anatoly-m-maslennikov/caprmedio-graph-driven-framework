# Summary

Register depends_on and required_by relation pair

## Scope

the `depends_on` **and** `required_by` relation pair.

## Claim

`depends_on` **means** a direct dependency-ordering relation from a dependent Artifact **to** its prerequisite Artifact, with `required_by` as its inverse-derived view. Plan start dependencies use the Plan Graph's `BLOCKS` under CA-R-1580 instead; this Relation Kind **must not** duplicate that scheduling fact.
