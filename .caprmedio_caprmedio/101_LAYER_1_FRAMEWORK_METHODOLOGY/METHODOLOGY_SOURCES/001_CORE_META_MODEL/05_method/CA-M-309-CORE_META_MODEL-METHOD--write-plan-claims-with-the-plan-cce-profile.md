# Summary

Write Plan Claims with the Plan CCE Profile

## Scope

Plan Claims written with the Plan CCE Role Profile.

## Claim

**to** write a Plan Claim with the Plan CCE Role Profile, the Author **must** perform **all** of:

1. state the Plan's primary contribution as intended work, an intended outcome, **or** their governed composition under CA-M-306-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-METHOD--author-plan-atoms.
2. **if** the Plan has own work, identify the action, its object, intended result, Assignee, **and** applicable boundary explicitly. modality, condition, temporal, quantification, logical, restriction, predicate, **and** comparison Operators **may** qualify that intended work.
3. **if** the Plan is supported **only** by decomposition, state its intended outcome **without** inventing own work.
4. keep reusable procedure authority, normative product boundaries, current realization facts, **and** reusable operational behavior outside the Plan's primary contribution.
5. write the Definition of Done as the subordinate falsifying Condition Expression under CA-M-123-CORE_META_MODEL-METHOD--write-definitions-of-done. condition, temporal, quantification, logical, predicate, restriction, **and** comparison Operators **may** occur **in** that slot **only** to determine whether the Plan remains **not** Done.
6. keep optional Details subordinate **to** the same intended work **or** outcome; Details **must not** introduce another intended outcome **or** a second Definition of Done.

## Details

an action word **in** a Plan identifies intended work. it does **not** define a reusable Operations Action.
