# Summary

Write Method Claims with the Method CCE Profile

## Scope

Method Claims with the Method CCE Role Profile.

## Claim

**to** write a Method Claim with the Method CCE Role Profile, the Author **must** perform **all** of:

1. state the primary contribution as one reusable authorship, construction, **or** Implementation choice **or** convention for satisfying accepted Spec authority under CA-R-1340.
2. use **to** for the governed method purpose. identify the applicable inputs, construction **or** selection choices, dependencies, produced result, **and** unresolved-choice handling necessary for reuse. include a performer, order, repetition, **or** stopping condition **only when** the convention requires it; do **not** invent an operational Action **or** Workflow **to** fill a Method template.
3. use condition, temporal, quantification, logical, restriction, predicate, **and** comparison Operators **only** with explicit scope over the affected method content.
4. use modality **only** to constrain correct performance of the Method; the Method **must not** create an independently governed product outcome **or** permission that belongs **in** Requirement authority.
5. use **means** **only** **when** defining the governed Method subject **or** one necessary Method-local term.
6. reference applicable Requirement, Evaluation, Delivery, **and** Operations authority rather than reproducing their independently governed contributions as method steps.
7. **when** the Method concerns tests, govern how their implementation is constructed **or** selected. the test's checked behavior, fixture, acceptance policy, expected result, **and** disposition remain Evaluation authority; its executable test code is Implementation.

## Details

the Method profile governs how accepted authority is satisfied. it does **not** turn one intended Plan action **or** one reusable Operations Action into a Method.
