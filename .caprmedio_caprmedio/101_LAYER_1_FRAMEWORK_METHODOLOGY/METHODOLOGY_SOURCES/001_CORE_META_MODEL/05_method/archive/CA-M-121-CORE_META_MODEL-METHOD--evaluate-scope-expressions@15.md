# Evaluate Scope Expressions

**to** evaluate one Scope Expression, the Resolver **must** perform **all** of:

1. resolve **every** exact Atom ID **or** other atomic identity **to** **`=1`** Governed Entity.
2. interpret **all** `<ENTITY_KIND>` as **every** Governed Entity of that kind within Atom Scope.
3. interpret **or** as set union.
4. interpret **and** as set intersection.
5. interpret **without** as left-side set exclusion.
6. interpret **where** as retention of **only** members whose field predicate evaluates **to** true according **to** CA-M-122.
7. evaluate the innermost parenthesized set function **before** its containing set function.
8. use another Scope function **only** **when** an active CCE Method gives that function **`=1`** set meaning.
