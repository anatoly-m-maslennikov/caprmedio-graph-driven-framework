# Summary

Keep CA **and** specialist skills thin

## Scope

the CAPRMEDIO Main Skill `ca` and specialist entry Skills.

## Claim

the CAPRMEDIO Main Skill `ca` **and** specialist entry Skills **must** remain very thin bootstrap **and** response handlers rather than contain task-specific procedures.

- retain **only** the standing instructions needed **to** establish the owning Project's framework connection, use the admitted MCP interface, handle Step responses, return actual results, **and** report unavailable inputs, failures, **or** escalation needs. a specialist entry **may** identify its registered route **without** copying that route's procedure.
- obtain task-specific instructions **and** necessary context through MCP responses for the current admitted Agentic Step under CA-R-1522-WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR-REQUIREMENT--provide-workflow-orchestration-from-methodology **and** `CA-R-1789-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL--provide-self-contained-agentic-step-invocation-payloads`. the response supplies the Action instructions, bound inputs **or** accessible references, required output, **and** execution boundaries. do **not** preload the whole Methodology, unrelated resources, **or** future-Step instructions merely **to** remember what comes next.
- keep Workflow transitions **and** execution state with the executor. the Skill **must not** independently select the next Step, replay an uncertain effect, **or** infer completion from receiving a prompt. additional context required by the current Step remains admissible; thinness **must not** omit governing authority **or** necessary inputs.
- retain methodology Action **and** Workflow definitions as behavioral authority. ACTION_PROMPTS implements the Action instructions under CA-R-1601-PROMPTS-DEFINES_GOAL_FOR-ACTION_PROMPTS--implement-actions-as-agent-instructions; the MCP response delivers the bound invocation, **not** another independently authored procedure. reference canonical Tools **and** the shared runtime rather than embedding **or** copying executable helpers into Skills.
- keep MCP-delivered instructions within current Operator authorization **and** the admitted Step context. a response does **not** expand delegation, replace higher authority, **or** authorize a guessed fallback procedure **when** the framework connection is unavailable. Integrated **and** Isolated participation retain CA-R-1527-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--define-agentic-step-execution-context's existing boundary.
