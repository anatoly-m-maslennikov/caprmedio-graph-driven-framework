# Summary

Compose short current implementation Step prompts

## Scope

one self-contained prompt per current CA-O-016 Step.

## Claim

**to** implement one Step prompt, state its exact Step, Action, and context; name required inputs, permitted work, output artifacts, admitted result labels, and blocking conditions without restating methodology authority.

## Details

Keep each prompt concise, pin-aware, and scoped to its own Step. Its named
inputs include the `selected_project` binding, current pinned source
references, the verified active-M Projection, and the existing workspace and
matching disposable-workspace capability when work may write. Resolve governed
sources only under that selected Project binding; do not infer a root from the
prompt package, current directory, a host path, or a mount. The caller owns
transitions and dispatch; a prompt does not route future Steps, infer a pass,
or grant a workspace, credential, or transport capability.
