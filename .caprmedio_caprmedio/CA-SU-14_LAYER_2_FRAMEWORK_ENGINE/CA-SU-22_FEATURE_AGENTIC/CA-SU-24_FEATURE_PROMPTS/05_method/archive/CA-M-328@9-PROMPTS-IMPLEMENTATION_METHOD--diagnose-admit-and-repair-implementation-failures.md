# Summary

Diagnose, admit, and repair implementation failures

## Scope

the diagnosed repair path after a selected Implementation Workflow check does not pass.

## Claim

**to** handle a failure, retain the actual failing evidence, diagnose its category, admit retry only through current permission/confidence/retry guards, repair the admitted defect, and return for renewed preparation or checking.

## Details

Changed failures, stale evidence, unavailable authority, or non-progressing work block. Repair preserves issue evidence and does not create or promote an M atom.
