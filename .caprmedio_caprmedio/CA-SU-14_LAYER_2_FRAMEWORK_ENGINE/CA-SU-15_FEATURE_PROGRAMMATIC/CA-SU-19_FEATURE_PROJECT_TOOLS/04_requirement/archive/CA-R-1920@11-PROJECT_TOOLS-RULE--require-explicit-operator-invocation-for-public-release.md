# Summary

Require explicit Operator invocation for public release

## Scope

one public-release Workflow invocation.

## Claim

**the Operator** **must** explicitly authorize the exact selected public-release request, definition manifest, source-currentness proof, effect set, and personal remote before a public commit, push, or PR effect begins.

## Details

Preview, preparation, and planning do not authorize execution. Missing, stale, or differently bound authorization stops before any remote effect.
