# Summary

Require an actual PR link in Version History

## Scope

one Version History entry for one public release.

## Claim

**the Operator** **must** record only a concise selected-Version summary and the actual matching public PR hyperlink in that Version History entry.

## Details

A guessed URL, placeholder, prose-only reference, or unrelated PR does not satisfy the Claim. When the actual URL becomes known after the initial push, CA-O-198 owns mechanical finalization and same-PR refresh without another suite or prompt.
