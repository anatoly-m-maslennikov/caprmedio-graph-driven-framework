# Summary

Validate personal remote and branch boundary

## Scope

the remote and branch fields of one public-release request.

## Claim

**the Operator** **must** verify that only an explicit personal remote with `amm/dev` head and `main` base is admitted, while missing remote identity, another scope, or any branch change is refused before effects.

## Details

The case verifies configuration boundaries, not remote credentials or GitHub access.
