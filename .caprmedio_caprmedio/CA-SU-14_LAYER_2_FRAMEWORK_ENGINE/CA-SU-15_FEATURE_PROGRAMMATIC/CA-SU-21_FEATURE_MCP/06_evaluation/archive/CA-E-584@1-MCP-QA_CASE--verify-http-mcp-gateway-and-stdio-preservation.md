# Summary

verify HTTP MCP Gateway and stdio preservation

## Scope

the additional localhost HTTP transport for the existing Project MCP Gateway.

## Claim

the Evaluation **must** verify that real MCP HTTP initialization, discovery, calls and reload use the existing Gateway without breaking stdio behavior.

## Details

1. build e2e fixtures first with a real Gateway and disposable mock implementation. Exercise handshake, Tool discovery and a Tool call through the real Streamable HTTP application.
2. reload the mock implementation on the same HTTP connection and verify the new registry and result; preserve an in-flight old-generation call until it drains.
3. exit the HTTP lifespan and verify Session and generation cleanup. Run the existing stdio hot-reload tests unchanged.
4. verify the Docker service's localhost URL through an actual container when Docker is available; a mock or host-ASGI pass is not that Docker gate.
