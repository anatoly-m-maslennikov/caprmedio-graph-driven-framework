# Summary

Derive the registered selected pin refresh

## Scope

the exact admitted selected-source revision refresh under the current Epic.

## Claim

**to** refresh the accepted selected source revision, derive the successor from the exact prior binding and the current registered source before applying the existing authorized publication lifecycle.

## Details

1. reopen the one CA-D-588-MCP-DELIVERY--register-the-prepared-successor-binding-refresh registration and its exact input binding, current sources and retained prior source bytes.
2. replace **only** its declared pin occurrences; verify their count and route ownership. retain every other field except the resulting binding and canonical digests.
3. validate the whole successor against current source pins and the existing selected-route schema. reject changes beyond the registration before writes.
4. seal the exact derived candidate under the existing trusted Operator context. rederive before intent and publication; record the actual write and exact-byte readback through the existing lifecycle.
5. retain pending publication or recording evidence for recovery. historical evidence and installed runtime remain unchanged.
