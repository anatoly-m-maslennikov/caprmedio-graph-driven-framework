# Summary

How should the binding Journal history gap be reconciled

## Concern

may a separately authorized bounded reconciliation record the exact current Git-backed binding state before retrying guarded refresh, while preserving all historical event bytes and making no claim that the historical writes were replayed or journaled when they occurred?

## Evidences

- the approved refresh capability is implemented at d24eb8d89 with independent source/code acceptance and passing focused regression tests.
- the first actual attempt returned `blocked` before any Manifest write or sealed pending intent: its canonical carrier history does not match the selected Manifest bytes.
- the current raw SHA-256 is `e58209ebdfa598e7ed30b87abeac43606ab3fec35238c99870ea1a01a5a62946`, exactly matching Git HEAD's file. the last path-changing commit is 284772bb818f1c7c5c566b59dde327ca855e5ae4.
- the latest target-specific canonical event is revision 2, `release-manifest:81cf4fac9b9087e14d451502fa1be473c664eea1f7f4b74e1032ba1b084449a7`, with raw SHA-256 `1eabfd2f1a0df45ae0df2ff4b2221ebe557ef1f520a990ef6d10f542259d6723`. later Git rebinding commits have no corresponding generic carrier event.
- no `release-manifest:` pending intent exists. the current binding and installed N are unchanged. this is a pre-existing history gap, not a failed replacement to replay.

## Blast radius

the canonical selected-workflow binding and its existing carrier history only. do not alter historical Journal bytes, restore an obsolete binding, silently adopt an unproven dirty state, or claim a completed Release.

## Details

the Operator approved source-first reconciliation and continuation. R1893/M349/E592/D587 and implementation commit `7a15f736b` have independent acceptance with 28 focused reconciliation/refresh/lifecycle passes. the existing recovered-state schema preserves an exact nested predecessor witness rather than fabricating a historical change. actual observation `release-manifest-reconciliation:99232777f00d64d09e48155c3aefd1fe3b35c94678a16dd64d99a9b5c6daef59` records current state v3; actual refresh `release-manifest:57af554ee877ac760ed9ec157b191cfd4dda085927de0a35b8fb20fd659b11e8` records the linked change v4. both are verified once, no binding event is pending, and ordinary strict admission accepts all sixteen routes. historical Journal bytes and installed N are preserved. CA-P-1781 and CA-P-1780 are Done; this resolves the history gap, not the remaining full Release gate.
