# Preserve Tool contracts and authority

MCP **must** preserve each Tool's accepted inputs, structured outputs, diagnostics, failures, target-set identity, **and** side-effect controls **without** changing their meaning. MCP **must** preserve Finder read-only behavior, Checker evidence **and** verdict behavior, Doer dry-run **and** explicit-apply behavior, **and** **every** Tool permission boundary; it **must** never broaden mutation authority, infer approval, **or** convert a failed **or** partial Tool result into success.

For CAPRMEDIO Markdown Atom Doers, MCP **must** pass through the canonical Tool's sealed target set, expected revision **or** digest, Initiative action envelope, **and** resulting receipt. It **must not** replace a Tool's atomic **or** bulk cardinality, preflight, conflict, recovery, **or** lifecycle decision with transport behavior of its own.
