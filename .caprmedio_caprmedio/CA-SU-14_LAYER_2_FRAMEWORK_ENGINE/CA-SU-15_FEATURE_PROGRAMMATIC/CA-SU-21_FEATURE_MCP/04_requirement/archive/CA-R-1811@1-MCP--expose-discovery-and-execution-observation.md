# Summary

Expose discovery and execution observation

## Scope

the MCP capability for MCP.

## Claim

the MCP interface **must** expose the declared discovery, context **and** execution-observation Tools with the canonical Implementation's input schemas **and** results.

## Details

- expose discover_tools, discover_operations, get_execution_context, get_execution_status, resume_execution_context **and** watch_execution.
- call the same canonical Tool code used by direct invocation.
- watch_execution provides caller-requested updates through a bounded wait; an idle MCP connection does **not** independently deliver a new chat message.
- report supported Run backends explicitly; unsupported Workflow **or** standalone Action Runs remain explicit rather than fabricated.
