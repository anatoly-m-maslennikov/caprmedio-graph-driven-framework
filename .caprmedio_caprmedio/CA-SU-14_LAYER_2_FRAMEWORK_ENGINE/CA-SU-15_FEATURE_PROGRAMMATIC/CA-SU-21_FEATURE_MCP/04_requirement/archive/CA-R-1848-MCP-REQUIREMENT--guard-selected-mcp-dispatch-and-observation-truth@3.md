# Summary

Guard selected MCP dispatch and observation truth

## Scope

Authorization, currentness, result truth, and defer/handoff behavior at the selected MCP boundary.

## Claim

MCP **must not** report dispatch, completion, effects, or recording as successful unless the shared service returns exact current evidence for that fact.

## Details

Before a preview or execute, the adapter validates the selected route against exactly one outer `definition_manifest` reference/digest, its canonical binding, exact admitted source/definition revisions, root/frontier and target/reference digests, input schema, and parent lineage. The source-freshness object may carry only its selected-source registry/binding evidence: any `definition_manifest_ref`, `definition_manifest_digest`, or other duplicate/shadow manifest field there or anywhere else is an unknown field and is rejected before comparison, including a matching or different digest. Missing, incomplete, duplicate, malformed, digest-mismatched, changed, stale, conflicted, unsupported, unsealed, or unauthorized bindings return `blocked` or `rejected` without dispatch, Run, Action Run, worker start, effect, or Journal event. Preview has no mutation authority; `execute` without exact current Operator authorization returns `blocked`. The adapter must not substitute a newer source revision, widen a selected set, infer authority from a prior request, or accept an `apply` mode.

The shared service owns execution, cancellation, terminal state, durable event identity, and retry semantics. MCP preserves its outcome rather than translating a deferred, handoff-required, recording-blocked, failed, canceled, partial-effect, unknown-effect, or no-op result into success. A no-op has no invented mutation; a handoff includes the actual continuation/reference and no claimed local dispatch; an unstarted call has no invented Action Run. A terminal Action/Workflow result with pending recording exposes the actual result plus `recording_blocker` and pending event ref, not a clean completion.

Observation results disclose only references and redacted safe material authorized by the selected Run; they never fabricate output/results, reveal secrets, or treat an outbox/intake acknowledgement as an effect or Journal receipt. The adapter reports the source currentness observed for the operation and the exact Run/Event/Journal/report references returned by shared support. It is a projection boundary, not an authority to alter source, Artifact, or Journal history.
