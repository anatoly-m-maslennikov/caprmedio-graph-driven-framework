# Summary

Seal the private reference context for a Release suite

## Scope

The read-only Project control references required by the declared Release suite in addition to its sealed package rows.

## Claim

Before a Release suite executes, its Suite Owner **must** derive, byte-verify, copy read-only, and bind one closed canonical reference context. The context contains only the allowlisted selected-workflow bindings, Operator registry, Project settings, Project Structure, source-registry reference, CA-D-572 and every transitive pin it declares, the selected-manifest source-path closure, and the two exact Prompt binding frontiers declared by CA-D-580. It is private Suite-owner state, never a D566 candidate-inventory member, public request field, MCP route, Workflow, Run, Journal carrier, runtime state, secret, or arbitrary caller file.

## Details

Each context row has exactly `source_path`, lowercase SHA-256 `sha256`, and regular-file `mode`. Every path is Project-relative, allowlisted by the closed construction, regular, non-symlinked through every ancestor, and readable before the read-only workspace is mounted. The closure is rejected if a named root, source-registry resolution, D572 pin, transitive pin, selected-manifest path, digest, mode, or cardinality differs from current Project bytes.

The Suite Owner also binds the existing trusted internal candidate manifest SHA-256, compiled-candidate root, frozen selected N identity, and N image-context identity to this context. These are derived from existing trusted handoffs and actual selected-N evidence, not accepted as public envelope fields. A fresh currentness check immediately before execution and a rederivation after execution must match the pre-run closure and context digest. Any absence, mutation, symlink, unreadable byte, changed trusted binding, or post-run mismatch is non-passing and authorizes no candidate staging, runtime installation, Skill publication, selector change, image retirement, or source mutation.

The Prompt frontiers contain only their exact binding carriers and explicitly declared, current Atom pins. Identical shared pins are represented once; conflicting pins are rejected. This does not include arbitrary Project folders or obsolete Plan carriers merely because a historical test mentioned them.
