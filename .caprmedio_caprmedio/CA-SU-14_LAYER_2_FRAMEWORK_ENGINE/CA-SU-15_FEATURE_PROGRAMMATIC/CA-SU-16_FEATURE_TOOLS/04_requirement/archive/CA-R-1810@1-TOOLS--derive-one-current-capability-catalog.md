# Summary

Derive one current capability catalog

## Scope

the TOOLS capability for Capability Catalog.

## Claim

the Capability Catalog **must** be **`=1`** derived read model shared by Tool discovery, Operations discovery **and** execution-context retrieval.

## Details

- active source Atoms **and** authoritative Project Structure declare capabilities **and** scope ancestry.
- D-owned Tool bindings declare Implementation paths **and** Action bindings; observed files **and** registered MCP handlers establish observed availability.
- declared authority, observed Implementation **and** exposed execution are distinct facts.
- source changes invalidate the derived catalog. duplicate active identifiers, ambiguous bindings, malformed sources **and** bounded reads remain visible.
- the catalog is a Projection; its descriptions do **not** become a separately authored source of truth.
