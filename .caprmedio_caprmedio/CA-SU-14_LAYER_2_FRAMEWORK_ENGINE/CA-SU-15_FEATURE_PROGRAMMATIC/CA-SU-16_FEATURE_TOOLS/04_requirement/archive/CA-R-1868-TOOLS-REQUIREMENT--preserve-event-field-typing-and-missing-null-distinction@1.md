# Summary

Map Event field values without changing shared filter semantics

## Scope

The Journal-specific selector value extraction.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** pass each selected canonical Event field's exact value state to CA-R-1850 without coercion, normalization, or inferred filename value.

## Details

The Tool marks absent selectors as absent and explicit null as null. It delegates
all comparison and invalid-literal decisions to CA-R-1850 rather than defining
another type system.
