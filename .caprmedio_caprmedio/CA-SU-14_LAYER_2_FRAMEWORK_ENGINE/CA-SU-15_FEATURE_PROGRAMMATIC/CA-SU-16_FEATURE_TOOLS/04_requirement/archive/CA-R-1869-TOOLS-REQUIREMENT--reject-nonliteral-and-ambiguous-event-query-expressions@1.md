# Summary

Reject Event selectors outside the canonical namespace

## Scope

The Journal-specific selector admission boundary.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** reject every selector that does not resolve to one unambiguous canonical Event field before passing the expression to CA-R-1850.

## Details

SQL, code, grammar, boolean precedence, and literal validity remain exclusively
governed by CA-R-1850; this Requirement adds no second expression grammar.
