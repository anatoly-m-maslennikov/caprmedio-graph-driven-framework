# Summary

Map canonical Event fields to the shared query filter

## Scope

The Journal-specific selector namespace for QUERY_FILTER.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** expose every canonical Event field as a valid selector to CA-R-1850's shared QUERY_FILTER contract.

## Details

The namespace is the top-level canonical Event object plus dot-qualified object
fields. The Tool retains this selector mapping only; equality, inequality, NOT,
IN, boolean precedence, missing/null, and type semantics are exactly CA-R-1850.
