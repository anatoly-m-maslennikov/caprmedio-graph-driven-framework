# Summary

Rebind Create contracts to current numbering authority

## Concern

Three Create contracts still rely on retired CA-D-450 instead of its current equivalent successor CA-D-508.

## Evidences

Independent P1472 fully read archived D450@5 and Active D508v1. Current sources preserve the same unreused Project-wide per-Content-Role numbering meaning; only the active authority reference needs rebinding.

## Blast radius

### Resolution

P1481 rebound O032v5/R865v14/E303v14 to Active D508v1 without changing numbering meaning or Versions. P1483 independently compared D508/D450 and current bindings and returned PASS. Source reference defect resolved.

### Original impact

The exact bound repair and independent review precede affected source acceptance. Preserve meaningful source/history and truthful proof; no runtime completion is claimed.
