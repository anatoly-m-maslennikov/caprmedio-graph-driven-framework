# Summary

How to publish Framework selection and Skill safely

## Concern

The full-Framework selector and public Skill are separate carriers. Choose a private exact pending-promotion receipt, complete package/Skill staging and gate verification before exposure, atomic selector replacement followed by publication of the bound complete Skill. This preserves D563's rule that candidate Skill publication follows N+1 selection; failures retain exact previous and candidate bytes and report pending rather than claim a fictitious cross-carrier atomic transaction. At88% design confidence, this is preferable to exposing N+1 Skill while N is selected or inventing another selector authority. Retry must match the exact same candidate, prior selector and planned Skill; unknown ownership and stale inputs refuse. P1693 implements this choice and proves recovery before the parent can close.

## Evidences

D562 requires atomic current.toml promotion; D563 binds public .agents/skills/ca to the same accepted candidate. Their separate locations do not provide a single filesystem transaction. Actual full-suite/image gates still precede exposure.

## Blast radius

Release promotion and its recovery only. No actual repository selection, Skill publication, image removal or Operator permission bypass is authorized by this record.
