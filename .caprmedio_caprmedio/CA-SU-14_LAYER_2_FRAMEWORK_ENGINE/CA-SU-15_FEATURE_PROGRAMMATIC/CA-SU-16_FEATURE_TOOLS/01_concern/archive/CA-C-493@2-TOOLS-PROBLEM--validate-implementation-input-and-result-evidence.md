# Summary

Validate Implementation input and result evidence

## Concern

The current Implementation adapter checks R/D/E container shape and shallow performed-success output without establishing the complete O094/E519 packet and current-candidate coverage boundary.

## Evidences

The restored Implementation/Revert audit traced implementation_actions.py and the selected executor against O094/E519/M295. Accepted workspace alias handling is not defective. Current real Workflow/Action Journal and full release-container proof are still pending separately.

## Blast radius

The selected Implementation Workflow and final CA-P-1117 acceptance.

## Disposition

CA-P-1777 owns one source-governed validator and focused tests. Source cardinalities and effective settings remain authoritative. No source/mock result substitutes for actual queue, Docker or Journal completion.

## Resolution

CA-P-1777 closes the source defect with full input/coverage validation, retained retry authorization and exact performed candidate/phase evidence. Focused regressions and independent acceptance pass. Actual runtime proof remains a separate release gate.
