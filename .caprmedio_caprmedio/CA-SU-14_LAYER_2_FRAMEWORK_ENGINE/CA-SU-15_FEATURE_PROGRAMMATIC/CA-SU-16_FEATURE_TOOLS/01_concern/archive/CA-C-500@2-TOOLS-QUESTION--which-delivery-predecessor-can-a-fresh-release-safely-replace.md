# Summary

Which delivery predecessor can a fresh release safely replace

## Concern

which existing source delivery may a fresh Release replace when an earlier interrupted Release completed its delivery but did not promote the executing runtime?

## Evidences

- N11 stopped at Step 3 with release-copy-predecessor-mismatch before source delivery, compilation or Unit execution.
- all 14 actual N11 Run records are sealed; the historical Journal prefix is retained and no recording is pending.
- installed N remains unchanged. failed N9 and N10 completed earlier source-delivery phases without promotion.
- the current reader compares the occupied source-delivery tree to retained executing N. independent code, tree, authority and fixture lanes are identifying the exact mismatch and safe ownership evidence.

## Blast radius

only source-delivery predecessor admission and its retained evidence. preserve unknown files, authoritative sources, installed N, old Runs, and complete Release gates.

## Details

choose the smallest evidence-backed repair under the Operator's autonomous best-option authorization. retain this Question until ownership is independently accepted and a fresh Release passes delivery. do not replay N11 or bypass the mismatch guard.

### Selected repair

- the canonical N10 Event already binds the fixed delivered tree digest. it does not seal the raw Action result or checkpoint bytes, or establish their executing-N lineage.
- register those exact currently observed bytes and bindings prospectively in reviewed D567 authority under the Epic's autonomous best-option instruction. call this current admission of historical delivery evidence; do not assert historical sealing.
- the registration permits **only** retention and replacement of the exact occupied copy during a separately authorized fresh Release. **all** current pins, file and directory modes, safe topology and executing-N bindings must match on every read.
- preserve historical Events and interrupted Runs. this Question remains Active until independent acceptance and actual fresh source delivery.

## Result

the bounded source/code correction passed independent review and 103 focused tests. actual N12 completed delivery with expected and observed digest `504136b891165dcaef4dbc393e2c3af596e1fab6ea4d35b02584aedab4f0ed3c`; the exact N10 predecessor was retained and independently verified with unchanged historical evidence and installed N. this resolves the predecessor-selection Question without claiming Unit, image, E2E or promotion completion.
