# Summary

Finish duplicate Atom creation as a truthful non-effect

## Concern

The selected Create Atom workflow does not finish cleanly after a deterministic Atom ID collision. Its native adapter reports duplicate with an unchanged effect, but shared Run support returns disposition started with execution_error SelectedRunError and interrupted_pending Workflow and Step outcomes. A proven non-effect must not be represented as uncertain mutation or successful creation.

## Evidences

Run storage-i-ca-c-440-20261005-v1 collided with another session's already admitted CA-C-440. Its saved Action result is no-op, native_result.outcome is duplicate, and the effect reason is atom-id-collision with state unchanged. Its accepted.json contains execution_error SelectedRunError, and the Workflow and Step terminal records are interrupted_pending. The existing Concern was not overwritten; the intended legacy-consumer Concern was resubmitted under a fresh identity.

## Blast radius

Concurrent sessions can encounter ordinary identity-allocation collisions. The native refusal protects authority, but the shared lifecycle result path needs a bounded functional test and repair so deterministic duplicates finish with truthful non-effect records. Retain existing Journal and receipt history; do not replay the old request or weaken identity uniqueness checks.
