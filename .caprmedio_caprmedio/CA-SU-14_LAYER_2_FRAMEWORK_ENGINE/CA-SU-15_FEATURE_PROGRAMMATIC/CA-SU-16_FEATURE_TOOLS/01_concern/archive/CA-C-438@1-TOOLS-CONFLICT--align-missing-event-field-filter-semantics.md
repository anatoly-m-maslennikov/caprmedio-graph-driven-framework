# Summary

Align missing Event field filter semantics

## Concern

CA-R-1869 version 2 rejected an absent Event pointer locally, conflicting with
CA-R-1850's shared comparison rule that an absent selector compares false and
that explicit `null` remains a value.

## Resolution

CA-R-1869 version 3 limits local rejection to selector namespace, RFC6901
escaping or syntax, and dot-qualified traversal. A syntactically valid Event
pointer absent from an individual Event now reaches CA-R-1850 unchanged.
CA-E-575 version 3 records the explicit missing-versus-null fixture. This
resolves only the source conflict; it makes no runtime implementation claim.
