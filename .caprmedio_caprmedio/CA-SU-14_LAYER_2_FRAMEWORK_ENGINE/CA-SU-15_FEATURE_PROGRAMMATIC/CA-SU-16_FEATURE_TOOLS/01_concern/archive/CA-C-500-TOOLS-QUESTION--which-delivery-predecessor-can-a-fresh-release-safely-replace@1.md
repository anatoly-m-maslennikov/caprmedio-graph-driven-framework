# Summary

Which delivery predecessor can a fresh release safely replace

## Concern

which existing source delivery may a fresh Release replace when an earlier interrupted Release completed its delivery but did not promote the executing runtime?

## Evidences

- N11 stopped at Step 3 with release-copy-predecessor-mismatch before source delivery, compilation or Unit execution.
- all 14 actual N11 Run records are sealed; the historical Journal prefix is retained and no recording is pending.
- installed N remains unchanged. failed N9 and N10 completed earlier source-delivery phases without promotion.
- the current reader compares the occupied source-delivery tree to retained executing N. independent code, tree, authority and fixture lanes are identifying the exact mismatch and safe ownership evidence.

## Blast radius

only source-delivery predecessor admission and its retained evidence. preserve unknown files, authoritative sources, installed N, old Runs, and complete Release gates.

## Details

choose the smallest evidence-backed repair under the Operator's autonomous best-option authorization. retain this Question until ownership is independently accepted and a fresh Release passes delivery. do not replay N11 or bypass the mismatch guard.
