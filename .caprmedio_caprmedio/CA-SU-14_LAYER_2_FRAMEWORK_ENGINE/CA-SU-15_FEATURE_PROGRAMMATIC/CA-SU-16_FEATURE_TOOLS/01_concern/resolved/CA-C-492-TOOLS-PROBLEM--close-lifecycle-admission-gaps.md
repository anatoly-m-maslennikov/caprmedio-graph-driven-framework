# Summary

Close lifecycle admission gaps

## Concern

The restored code-vs-RMED/O audit found malformed-history identity reuse in Create, missing exact assessment binding in Update and caller-controlled archival models in Replace.

## Evidences

Current lifecycle_intents.py, atom_operations.py and selected_execution.py were compared with O128, O145, O129 and O051. Change Status has no additional native blocker; actual all-role Docker proof remains pending.

## Blast radius

The selected lifecycle Workflows, their preserved identity/history and final CA-P-1117 acceptance.

## Disposition

CA-P-1775 owns test-first implementation and independent acceptance. Current source contracts remain authoritative; do not amend them to excuse code defects or count source tests as Docker proof.

## Resolution

CA-P-1775 and CA-P-1778 close the source defects with 31 focused regressions and independent acceptance. Actual selected lifecycle execution remains a separate release gate.
