# Summary

Choose semantic Update assessment evidence

## Concern

How should the native Update Workflow consume independent semantic and lineage-impact assessment evidence without treating the requested change class as proof or the report as permission?

## Evidences

O067 and R1432 require exact change authority, preserved primary Claim identity, declared semantic delta and lineage-impact review. Current native code can independently prove lossless normalization, but must return unresolved for other changes without external evidence.

## Blast radius

The substantive Update capability and CA-P-1117 final acceptance.

## Selected option

Under the Operator's autonomous best-option direction, use one current completed Analysis Report with exact target/proposal/authority and lineage evidence pins. O145 verifies and seals it; O129 revalidates it before effects. The report carries findings, not mutation permission. Use the current source-derived Analysis whitelist with completed Status Done, already declared by current authority.

This is Tool-specific R/M/E/D, not a new Core Meta-Model implementation schema, Actor system or competing source of truth. CA-P-1778 owns implementation and independent acceptance; keep this Question active until the selected interface is proven.

## Resolution

The selected interface is implemented and independently accepted with source-bound semantic success and fail-closed tampering regressions. It remains evidence, not mutation permission. CA-P-1778 is locally complete; actual Docker execution remains separately required.
