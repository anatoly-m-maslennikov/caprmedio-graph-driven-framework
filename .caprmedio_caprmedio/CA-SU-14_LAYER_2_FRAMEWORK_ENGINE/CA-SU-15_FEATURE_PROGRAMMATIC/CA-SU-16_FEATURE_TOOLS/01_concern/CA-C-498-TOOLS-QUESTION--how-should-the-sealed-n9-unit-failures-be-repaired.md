# Summary

How should the sealed N9 Unit failures be repaired

## Concern

which bounded source, closure and fixture corrections allow the complete sealed Unit gate to pass without bypassing currentness, exposing Docker to isolated Unit execution or weakening mandatory release checks?

## Evidences

- N9 snapshot `8ed0ede974f9196985bdef76ac1742bf5d70729d94e9f1fe9479172be6933c54` actually reports 1,925 testcases, 16 failures and 57 errors, with exit 1 after 816.0929900840056 seconds.
- source delivery and compilation completed; the gate stopped before candidate image, promotion or retirement.
- terminal interrupted Action/Step/Workflow events are recorded. the saved execution-stop checkpoint does not mean a remaining pending event.

## Blast radius

only confirmed N9 failure groups and the exact two Prompt binding source frontiers; preserve installed N, historical Runs and Journal rows.

## Details

use the nine independent CA-P-1782 child lanes. accepted fixture corrections remain separate from passing the fresh complete release gate. R1887/M344/E587/D580 establish the narrow private source closure before implementation; preserve the existing schema-1 reference_rows carrier. choose the bounded best correction under Operator authorization and record unresolved uncertainty here; no replay of failed N9.
