# Summary

Complete authorized Scope Unit Remove and no-op

## Scope

Golden remove and no-op cases for one declared unit with affected references and observed Carrier content.

## Claim

The Evaluation **must** prove Remove preserves or reports all affected material and a true no-op performs no mutation.

## Details

- Remove only a declaration whose exact preservation/breakage disposition is authorized; assert every affected Atom, definition, reference, and Carrier is preserved or explicitly returned as breakage.
- Verify neither recursive directory deletion nor implicit Carrier deletion occurs.
- Repeat the already-satisfied request and assert `no_op`, unchanged TOML revision, empty actual effect set, and no fictitious mutation or success evidence.
