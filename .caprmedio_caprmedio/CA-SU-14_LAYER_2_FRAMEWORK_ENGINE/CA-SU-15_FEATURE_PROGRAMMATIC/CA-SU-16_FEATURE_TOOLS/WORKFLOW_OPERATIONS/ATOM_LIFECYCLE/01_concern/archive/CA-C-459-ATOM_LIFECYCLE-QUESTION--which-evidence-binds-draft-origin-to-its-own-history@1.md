# Summary

Which evidence binds Draft origin to its own history

## Concern

Mutable Draft provenance can describe an admitted origin but cannot prove that an arbitrary valid archive belongs to that Draft. Options considered: trust the mutable map; add a self-hash/signature without a trust authority; or bind admitted Draft outputs to immutable retained Atom history. Choose the third, at 88% design confidence, because it uses existing history rather than a second identity registry and closes the actual counterexamples. Each current Draft carries a pre-addressable history-entry reference; that entry binds its exact output locator and digest, direct parent lineage and origin. Lifecycle effects are the admitted writers of retained history. Out-of-band Draft bytes without a matching entry fail closed; an Operator able to reauthor both authority and history is outside the untrusted-request boundary. P1675/P1676 define and review the minimum source contract before code. A self-hash alone is not claimed to authenticate origin.

## Evidences

P1638's saved rejected review and independent origin adjudication identify the exact branches and source claims. Prior partial passing evidence is retained, not converted into a clean pass.

## Blast radius

The bounded Draft identity promotion path and its source history contract. No mandatory image/permission gate is bypassed and no broad identity registry or new Journal is introduced.
