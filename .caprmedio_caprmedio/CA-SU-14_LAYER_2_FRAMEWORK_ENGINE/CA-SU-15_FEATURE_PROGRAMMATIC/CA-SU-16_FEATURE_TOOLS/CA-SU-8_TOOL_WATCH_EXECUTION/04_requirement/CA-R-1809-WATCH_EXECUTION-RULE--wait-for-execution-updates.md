# Summary

Wait for execution updates

## Scope

the WATCH_EXECUTION capability for Tool/WATCH_EXECUTION.

## Claim

the WATCH_EXECUTION Tool **must** return correlated execution updates after a caller's cursor, including completion, failure, interruption, handoff, progress, and evidence-recording changes.

## Details

- implement the methodology Action CA-O-117-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-ACTION--wait-for-execution-updates.
- accept a supported Run ID, opaque cursor and bounded wait timeout; return a new cursor, updates, current status, timeout state, and full report reference.
- preserve the Operator's choice of what **to** execute; discovery, context retrieval, **and** observation provide capabilities.
- bounded **or** unavailable evidence **must** remain explicit **rather than** establish a successful assessment.
