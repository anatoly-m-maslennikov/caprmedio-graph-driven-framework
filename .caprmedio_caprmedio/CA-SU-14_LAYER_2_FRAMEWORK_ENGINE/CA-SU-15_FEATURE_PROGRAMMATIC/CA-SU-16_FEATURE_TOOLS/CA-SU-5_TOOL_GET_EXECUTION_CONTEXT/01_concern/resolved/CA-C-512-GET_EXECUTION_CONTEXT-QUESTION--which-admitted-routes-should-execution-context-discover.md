# Summary

Which admitted routes should execution context discover

## Concern

live Create and Update context requests fail despite their current admitted MCP bindings; only Release Version is synthesized into the discovery catalog. a shared Action request expands the whole RMED scope and exceeds its context budget.

## Evidences

the live MCP reproduces generic context errors for create_atom and update_atom. the read-only source helper raises Unknown or ambiguous capability for create_atom; Release Version returns current revision-9 bindings. O128 v4 is read correctly but its broad same-scope expansion returns incomplete context.

## Blast radius

discovery and context retrieval for the existing sixteen selected capabilities. this does not authorize new routes, Action effects, or a release result.

## Decision

apply existing R1804, R1805 and R1806: expose every currently validated and registered selected route in discovery, return its route-specific input schema, and keep admitted Action context bounded to its exact source and actual bindings. disclose all bindings for a shared Action rather than selecting one route or granting dispatch authority. preserve explicit gaps and fail-closed stale-source behavior.

## Result

the discovery suite passes 16 cases and the isolated MCP suite passes 4 cases; independent review accepts the manifest-validated exposed-route catalog and schema behavior. after an explicit hot reload, all sixteen route-name contexts, Workflow CA-O-136 and shared Action CA-O-128 return complete current bindings. O128 discloses all four lifecycle routes with no arbitrarily selected input schema. no Action or Workflow was executed by these read-only checks.
