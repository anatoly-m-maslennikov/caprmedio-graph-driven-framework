# Summary

Find Workflows and Actions by outcome

## Scope

the DISCOVER_OPERATIONS capability for Tool/DISCOVER_OPERATIONS.

## Claim

the DISCOVER_OPERATIONS Tool **must** return a ranked, bounded selection of active Workflow and Action definitions matching the requested outcome and filters.

## Details

- implement the methodology Action CA-O-113-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-ACTION--discover-operations.
- accept a query, Workflow or Action kind, Scope Unit and execution-kind filters, offset, and result limit; return summaries, definition bindings, and implementation availability.
- preserve the Operator's choice of what **to** execute; discovery, context retrieval, **and** observation provide capabilities.
- bounded **or** unavailable evidence **must** remain explicit **rather than** establish a successful assessment.
