# Summary

Verify actual query Run journaling through shared support

## Claim

The Tool creates shared RunJournal evidence only for an actual admitted query execution and creates none for preview or denied requests.

## Test case

Run preview, denied execute, and admitted execute against one stable source snapshot.

## Acceptance criteria

Preview and denial have no Run/Event identity; admitted execute has truthful Workflow/Step/Action lineage and cannot affect its result snapshot.

## Failure disposition

Reject fake Runs, preview Events, competing logs, or snapshot mutation.
