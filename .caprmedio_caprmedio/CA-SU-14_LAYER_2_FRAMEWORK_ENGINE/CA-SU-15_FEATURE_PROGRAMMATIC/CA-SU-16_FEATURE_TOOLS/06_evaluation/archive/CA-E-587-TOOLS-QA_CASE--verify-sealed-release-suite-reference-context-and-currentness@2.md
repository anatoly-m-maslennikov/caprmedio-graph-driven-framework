# Summary

Verify sealed Release-suite reference context and currentness

## Scope

Positive and refusal checks for private control-reference capture, read-only workspace copying, and post-run revalidation.

## Claim

The QA case **must** prove that the Suite Owner passes only with one exact, allowlisted, read-only reference closure bound to the trusted candidate, compiled root, selected N, and image context; every changed or injected control reference is non-passing.

## Details

Verify a positive closure containing selected-workflow bindings, Operator registry, Project settings, Project Structure, resolved source-registry reference, CA-D-572, its transitive pins, and the selected-manifest source-path closure. Assert typed source-path ordering, exact byte SHA-256 and mode verification, canonical `control_context_digest`, workspace copy preservation, and its inclusion in actual suite evidence and the schema-2 envelope.

Independently reject an empty, duplicate, unknown, caller-added, runtime, Journal, secret-shaped, absolute, escaping, symlinked, non-regular, unreadable, wrong-mode, stale-digest, or stale-source-registry row. Mutate each allowed root and a transitive D572 pin between capture and execution, and again between execution and rederivation; neither case may pass or replay. Reject candidate SHA, compiled-root, selected-N, or image-context mismatch. Verify no arbitrary caller file reaches the workspace, no control carrier is written, and failure retains N and truthful non-passing evidence.
