# Reject strict orphan

## Test case

**Fixture:** leave an Active non-Goal tier-classified RMED Atom parentless **in** a strict scope, with its applicable Type **not** registered as orphan-permitted under CA-R-037. include a permitted orphan Type as a control.

**Expected result:** fail the non-exempt fixture with the stable strict-orphan diagnostic **and** a non-zero exit; do **not** reject the registered orphan-permitted control for parentlessness alone. this verdict diagnoses conformance **without** mutating the Atom, inventing a parent, **or** overriding the Operator's permission **to** retain a nonconforming Artifact.
