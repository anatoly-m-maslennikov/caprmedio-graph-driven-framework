# Summary

Encode the bounded Journal Event query interface

## Scope

The Tool input and result contract.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** deliver one bounded interface with a
snapshot token (source root, byte-prefix length/hash, ordered member hashes, and
Event-ID frontier), literal filter, JSON-Pointer Event selectors, result
selection, page request, and the shared configurable maxima for request bytes,
grammar depth, filter tokens, IN members, page size, selected fields, frontier
members, per-member bytes, total reads, timeout, and retained findings. Result
evidence reports each applicable configured and consumed/exhausted limit.

## Details

The interface has no SQL, code, secret, mutation, or implicit selection field.
