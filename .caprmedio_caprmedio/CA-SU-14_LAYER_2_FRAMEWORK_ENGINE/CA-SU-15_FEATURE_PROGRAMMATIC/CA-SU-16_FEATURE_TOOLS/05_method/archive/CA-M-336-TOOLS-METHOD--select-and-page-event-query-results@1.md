# Summary

Select and page Event query results

## Scope

Result construction.

## Claim

To construct results, the Tool **must** order snapshot matches deterministically, apply the bounded page, and expose IDs, selected fields, or full Events only in the requested mode with truthful coverage metadata.

## Details

The next-page token remains bound to the source snapshot and result selection; a request cannot use it against a new frontier.
