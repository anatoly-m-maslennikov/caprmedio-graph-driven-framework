# Summary

Capture a stable canonical Event frontier

## Scope

Source snapshot construction.

## Claim

To capture the query source, the Tool **must** enumerate canonical Event carriers once, seal their ordered references and digests into one opaque snapshot token, then read only that frontier.

## Details

The method detects changed, unreadable, duplicate, or malformed frontier members and returns their exact condition; it never retries by silently extending the frontier.
