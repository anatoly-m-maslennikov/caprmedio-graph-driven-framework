# Reject a class used only as a function namespace

## Claim checked

one deterministic responsibility that needs no identity **or** owned state is
implemented as specifically named functions **in** a module rather than as a class
used **only** for grouping.

## Test case

evaluate one changed class whose methods are **all** static deterministic
transformations **and** whose instances own no state, invariant, resource,
lifecycle, **or** adapter.

## Acceptance criteria

pass **only** **when** the class is rejected **and** the transformations are allocated **to**
specifically named functions **in** one cohesive module.

## Failure disposition

reject the changed allocation **until** the namespace-only class is removed.
