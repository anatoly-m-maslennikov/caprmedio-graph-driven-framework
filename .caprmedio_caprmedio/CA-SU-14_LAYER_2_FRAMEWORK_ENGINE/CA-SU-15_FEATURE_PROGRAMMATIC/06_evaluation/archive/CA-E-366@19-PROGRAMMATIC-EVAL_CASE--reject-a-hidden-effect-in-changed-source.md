# Reject a hidden effect in changed source

## Claim checked

one changed effect function declares its complete effect boundary **or** allocates
persistent ownership **to** an object.

## Test case

evaluate one changed function that reads the process environment implicitly
**before** writing its declared target.

## Acceptance criteria

pass **only** **when** the function is rejected **until** the environment observation is
an explicit input **or** an owned adapter boundary.

## Failure disposition

block the changed unit **until** the hidden observation is removed.
