# Verify owned state and lifecycle boundary

## Claim checked

one PROGRAMMATIC object that owns state, a resource, a lifecycle, **or** a
replaceable adapter exposes one bounded ownership **and** lifecycle boundary.

## Applicable conditions

apply **when** a component retains mutable state, acquires **or** releases a resource,
transitions through a lifecycle, **or** encapsulates one replaceable adapter.

## Test case

evaluate one object through its declared acquisition, use, failure, **and**
release **or** recovery transition.

## Acceptance criteria

pass **only** **when** **every** declared transition is observable, one owner remains
responsible for the state **or** resource, **and** no unrelated deterministic
responsibility is required **to** complete the transition.

## Failure disposition

stop the object boundary **and** split **or** redesign it **before** release.
