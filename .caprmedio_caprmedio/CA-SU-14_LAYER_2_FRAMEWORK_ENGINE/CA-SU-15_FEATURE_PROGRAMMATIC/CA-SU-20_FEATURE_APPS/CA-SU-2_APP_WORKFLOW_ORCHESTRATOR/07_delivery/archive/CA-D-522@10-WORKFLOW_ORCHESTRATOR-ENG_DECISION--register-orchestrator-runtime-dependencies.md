# Summary

Register orchestrator runtime dependencies

## Scope

WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR's initial local execution capability.

## Claim

the WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR runtime **must** declare its selected DBOS, Pydantic **and** PyYAML dependencies **in** the workflow-orchestrator dependency group.

## Details

- DBOS provides durable orchestration with a local SQLite backend.
- Pydantic admits strict JSON requests **and** Agent results; PyYAML supports safe Atom Carrier parsing.
- Codex CLI is a separately installed executable selected through the runner boundary; no Claude backend is implemented yet.
- versions are pinned **after** compatibility verification with the repository's supported Python series. runtime installation does **not** launch a worker **or** execute a Project Run.
