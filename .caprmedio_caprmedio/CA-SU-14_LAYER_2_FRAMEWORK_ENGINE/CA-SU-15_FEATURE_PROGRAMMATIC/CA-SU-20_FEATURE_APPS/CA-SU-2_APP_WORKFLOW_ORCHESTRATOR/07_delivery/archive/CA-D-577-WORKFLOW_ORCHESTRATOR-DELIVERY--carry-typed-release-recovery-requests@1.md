# Summary

carry typed Release recovery requests

## Scope

the WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR request and retained-state Carriers for recovering one frozen **Release Version** Workflow Run.

## Claim

the Release recovery request Carrier **must** contain only the typed operation, existing Run ID and sealed request identity needed to reopen an existing frozen Release Run.

## Details

- request schema: `operation: recover_selected_release`, `run_id` and `request_identity`. No arbitrary execution object, definition selection, Action payload, source path, permission grant, executor choice or effect instruction is admitted.
- the request is retained with the existing frozen selected request, dispatch intent, typed Release checkpoint, Action progress and result references in that Run's configured orchestrator state directory.
- canonical Workflow, Step and Action starts, recovered pending events, effects and terminal facts remain schema-v5 Work Journal records. The request Carrier, queue and DBOS state are transport and observation records, not a second Run Journal.
- the request response reports the same Run ID, operation disposition, canonical Journal references and blocked or pending reason where applicable. It does not claim a new Run, completion or recovered effect without exact canonical evidence.
