# Summary

bind Release execution to its host transport

## Scope

transport selection for source-admitted Release Version Runs in WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR.

## Claim

the Host Executor **must** bind **every** admitted Release Run **to** its exact frozen request **and** isolated host transport **before** scheduling it.

## Details

- validate the existing selected-route seals **and** current Source bindings **before** accepting a new Run.
- use the dedicated host Queue **and** worker; verify the frozen Release route again at worker dispatch.
- pass the fixed host namespace **to** the executor subprocess. do **not** change the MCP process's shared environment **to** select a transport.
- observation **and** recovery use the Run's retained transport binding. a Run bound **to** another executor is **not** adopted.
- unchanged requests can reuse their exact binding idempotently. a conflicting request, missing worker readiness **or** uncertain prior effect blocks continuation.
