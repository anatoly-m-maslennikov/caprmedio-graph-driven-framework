# Summary

verify Release host transport isolation

## Scope

admission, dispatch **and** observation of Release Runs through the isolated Host Executor.

## Claim

the Evaluation **must** verify that the Host Executor executes **only** its exactly bound, source-admitted Release Runs without changing another executor's Queue **or** adopting its Runs.

## Details

- preserve a queued native Base Revise Run **and** an existing Docker Queue while admitting a fresh Release host Run; check that **only** the host Queue changes.
- reject a non-Release request, foreign Run ID, changed request digest, stale Source pin, changed preview receipt **or** mismatched manifest **before** scheduler admission **or** effects.
- reject missing **or** mismatched host worker readiness without Docker **or** native fallback.
- verify explicit worker startup creates no Run **and** host dispatch independently checks the frozen Release route **and** transport binding.
- verify status **and** recovery require the retained binding; they do **not** adopt an earlier direct-host **or** Docker Run.
- distinguish mock scheduler tests from the actual Release gates. Unit tests, image checks, host end-to-end tests **and** promotion require their own real bound evidence.
