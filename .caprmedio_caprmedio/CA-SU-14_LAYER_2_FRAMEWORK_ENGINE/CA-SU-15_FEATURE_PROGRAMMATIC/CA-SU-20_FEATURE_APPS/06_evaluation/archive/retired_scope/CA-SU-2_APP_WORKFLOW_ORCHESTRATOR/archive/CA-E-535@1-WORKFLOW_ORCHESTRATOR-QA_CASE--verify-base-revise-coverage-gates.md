# Summary

Verify Base Revise coverage gates

## Scope

RMED Atoms Base Revise execution in WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR.

## Claim

the Coverage Gate Evaluation **must** verify complete **and** incomplete phase accounting without semantic rechecks.

## Details

- complete gather/check/fix permits completion with **`=3`** saved gate results.
- missing selection, evidence, check result, finding disposition **or** recording receipt prevents continuation **and** exposes missing work **and** an Operator question.
- initial failed checks with full evidence are covered; blocked **or** pending checks are **not** covered.
- verify no extra Agent dispatch for gates, no retry loop **and** no source write **after** a check-coverage failure.
- test real DBOS scheduling with mock Agents **before** a bounded live run.
