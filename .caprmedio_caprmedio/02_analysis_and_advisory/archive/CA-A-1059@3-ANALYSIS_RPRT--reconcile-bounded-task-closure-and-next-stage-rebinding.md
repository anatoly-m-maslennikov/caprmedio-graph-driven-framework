# Summary

Reconcile bounded Task closure and next-stage rebinding

## Question

Which propositions in saved CA-A-916 C05/D05 are already represented by current CA-O-017 v6 and CA-O-079 v4, and which require a distinct, reviewable gap or a project-specific/deferred disposition rather than duplicate authority?

## Scope

Exactly one saved family, C05/D05, under CA-P-1341. This is a bounded comparison, not Operation authoring, whole-corpus reconciliation, execution of historical migration, RMED acceptance, implementation, or a claim that historical reported Tasks were actually Done.

Inputs are the saved CA-A-916 v1, full current authoritative source Actions CA-O-017 v6 and CA-O-079 v4, current Goal v13, all fourteen active Project Principles and actor/permission authority, and CA-P-1117 v2 / CA-P-1119 v2 / CA-P-1130 v3. CA-P-1130 changed from its bound v2 during this task; its full v3 was reread. Its added family/remainder gates preserve this leaf's scope. The Operator-closed admitted corpus remains 102 completed packets / 5,463 records; partial CA-A-1043 is excluded and no native session was reopened.

Only this Analysis and CA-P-1341 may be changed. CA-C-351 remains unused: a retained substantive gap is the requested analysis result, not an unreported execution blocker or permission conflict.

## Approach

Read P1341 fully and C05/D05 with the complete relevant saved individual dispositions; read both current Operations in full. Verify unchanged authority against the retained full-read fingerprint ledger; reread changed current authority. Compare each constituent proposition without importing neighboring candidate families as new work.

The following local clause aliases identify bullets by their current source subsection and displayed order; they are explanatory references, not new canonical IDs:

- O017 IP1–IP6: six bullets in “Inputs and authority preparation.”
- O017 PP1–PP7: seven bullets in “Plan preparation and selection.”
- O017 RB1–RB4: four bullets in “Results and execution boundary.”
- O079 IN1–IN3: three bullets in “Inputs and preconditions”; B1–B6 are its numbered “Behavior”; RE1–RE3 are the three “Results and effects” bullets, followed by its explicit execution/Done exclusion.

Already-covered means the cited proposition is represented within the Operation's declared domain; it does not extend O017 from implementation preparation to every kind of Task. Gap means a useful, nonduplicative capability retained for independent review and bounded authoring, not a newly adopted normative Claim. Rejected means the stated interpretation is incompatible with current authority. Deferred preserves evidence outside this family or lacking present adoption. All rows have a destination; no historical proposal is automatically adopted.

## Results

### Exact saved evidence and authority distinction

CA-A-916 C05 states: “Run explicit ready Tasks sequentially in owned agents; preserve partial completion, evidence/unrelated work; close only after relevant validation/provenance; review/rebind next stage from actual result and insert newly required prerequisites without losing completed prefix.” Its evidence is human S027/S029 and reported S030/S038–S043/S046–S056/S063–S067/S077–S087/S090–S099. Its own provisional destination is a CORE_META_MODEL execution/handoff/replan Operation, with the exact caprmedio stage map in PROJECT_CONFIGURATION.

D05 ties human S027 to sequential execution / one Task per subagent and human S029 to reviewing the next subEpic against the actual predecessor result before execution. S028/S030 interpret safely startable read-only inventory while scope remained pending; S031 later resolves Active-only scope. The saved packet explicitly says these are historical delegations, not new permission to delegate or execute migration in this leaf.

Human S027/S029 establish what that historical request asked. Assistant S030 and subsequent reported completion, validation, hash/save, topology and next-task statements remain reports. Human continuations do not independently attest every assistant detail or adopt every neighboring proposal. Saved historical 99% thresholds are not the current inherited 90% threshold. No native original, command, reported hash, claimed Done, or historical instruction is executed or promoted to current authority here.

### Proposition-by-proposition disposition

| ID | Atomic proposition and saved evidence | Current coverage / exact limitation | Disposition and destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TC01 | Execute a persistent explicit Task, not an unowned transient checklist; bind its ready work and agent context (C05; S027/S030/S090). | O017 PP1 requires actual P/Plan Claims, Assignees and DoDs; PP4 selects exactly one ready bounded item/context with inputs, ownership, output, checks and prior results; RB3 blocks unmet prerequisites or permission. | Already-covered. Reuse CORE_META_MODEL O017 within implementation preparation; do not create a second equivalent selector. |
| TC02 | One selected Task per assigned execution context, respecting the requested sequence (D05 S027; C05 S090). | O017 PP4 supplies one selected item/context; PP3/PP5 supply actual prerequisite order, not folder order. The fixed historical queue is not a universal ordering rule. | Already-covered for the generic selected-item mechanism. Reuse O017; project-specific queue/assignment belongs to PROJECT_CONFIGURATION. |
| TC03 | Infer a universal ban on all independent parallel work from the historical word “sequential.” | Neither D05 nor O017 grants this universal rule. Current P1117 permits another independent ready task when one is postponed; readiness and explicit BLOCKS govern. | Rejected interpretation. No new CORE rule or caprmedio global concurrency prohibition. |
| TC04 | Prepare using current complete governing inputs, effective confidence and permission, rather than an old reported approval (C05 S030/S084–S086/S090). | O017 IP1/IP6 and PP4 bind current authority, boundaries and gates; IP3–IP5 govern its complete Method input projection. O079 IN2/IN3 and B6 require current Plan revisions and authorization. | Already-covered. Reuse O017/O079; actor authority CA-P-033 v9 / permission CA-P-034 v6 remain governing. |
| TC05 | Preserve partial progress and exact remaining work instead of declaring partial completion as whole completion (C05 S063/S066/S067/S087). | O017 PP6/PP7 retain results and residual work; O079 B1/B3 and RE3 distinguish completed, uncertain and unfinished effects and prohibit partial reconciliation as completion. | Already-covered. CORE O017/O079; retain evidence references rather than a duplicate completion history. |
| TC06 | Preserve unrelated work and boundaries while carrying out the selected task (C05 S038/S054/S090/S091). | O017 PP4 explicitly preserves unrelated work; O079 IN3/B3/B6 restrict authorized change and retain the Claim boundary. | Already-covered. Reuse CORE O017/O079; no unrelated edits, source rewrites or ownership expansion. |
| TC07 | Retain the completed prefix when work or authority is revised; do not reset effects or retries (C05 S079/S080/S084/S087). | O017 PP7 preserves completed work/evidence and disallows effect/retry reset after authorized authority changes; O079 B1/B3/B5 and final exclusion prevent replay or silently reopening completed work. | Already-covered. Reuse CORE O017/O079; exact retained caprmedio Plan IDs are PROJECT_CONFIGURATION inputs, not generic Operation text. |
| TC08 | Close selected implementation work only after relevant child DoDs and evaluations/validation are satisfied (C05 S039/S041/S043/S046/S047/S055/S056/S094/S099). | O017 RB2 directly requires all selected implementation work, required children, DoDs and applicable E, with no failed/blocked/stale/unevaluated obligation. O079 does not execute or mark work Done. | Already-covered within O017's implementation domain. Reuse O017 RB2; do not assign execution/closure effects to O079. |
| TC09 | Generalize that validation/provenance closure receipt to every bounded Task kind, including non-implementation handoffs (same C05 closure proposition). | The current Project controls and checkability/preservation Principles govern this leaf. O017's RB2 is not a generic Task-closing Action; O079 only maintains unfinished-work representation. Neither bound Action explicitly returns a generic closure receipt binding actual output/check evidence/current authority and affected dependents. | Gap G1, scoped to the generic closure/handoff boundary; retain for CORE independent review. Not evidence that current Plan/Status/E/Journal authority is absent or defective. |
| TC10 | Reference validation/completion provenance without copying authoritative completed-work history (C05 S038/S039/S041/S084/S094/S099). | O017 IP1/PP4/PP7/RB2 carry candidate evidence/prior results; O079 B3/B6/RE1 reference existing Plans/canonical Journal events and record actual authorized reconciliation effects. CA-R-1490 v1 and CA-E-001 v12 preserve/check results. | Already-covered for evidence preservation/reference. Reuse CORE O017/O079; G1 may bind existing evidence into its handoff receipt, not add a second Journal/preservation policy. |
| TC11 | After completion, review the affected next stage against the actual predecessor result before its execution (D05 human S029; C05 S030/S077/S083/S087/S099). | O017 IP1/PP4/PP7 and O079 IN1/B3 provide the necessary results/reconciliation mechanisms, but do not explicitly require a completion-triggered next-stage review when inputs/results change without an authority change. Current P1117 and P1130 already require it for this project. | Gap G1 for a reusable CORE trigger/handshake; already governed project behavior, not new current delegation. Do not claim O017 PP7's authority-change trigger equals this result-change trigger. |
| TC12 | Rebind every actually affected dependent Plan from the result/current authority before it starts; insert newly necessary prerequisites (C05 S077–S080/S087; D05 S029). | O079 B3/B4/B5/B6 covers authorized remaining-work edits, conditional creation, explicit BLOCKS and current-revision/placement checks; O017 PP3/PP5 covers acyclic prerequisite-first work. Neither bound Action alone enumerates all affected next Plans and proves completion-triggered rebinding before their execution. | Gap G1 for affected-set discovery, authorized rebinding and start gate. Reuse O079 as the reconciliation action and existing Plan authority; no duplicate replan Action. |
| TC13 | New prerequisites are explicit and navigation/decomposition must not masquerade as readiness (C05 S064/S077/S080/S087). | O017 PP3/PP5 and O079 B4/B5 provide decomposition ownership, actual blocking, acyclicity and prerequisite order. | Already-covered. CORE O017/O079; historical dependency wording must resolve to current explicit BLOCKS, not revive an obsolete Relation. |
| TC14 | Automatically run or mark Done as an effect of reconciling unfinished-work representation. | O079 Claim and final paragraph explicitly exclude execution, restarting a Run, replaying effects or marking Done. O017 RB3 still requires execution permission/readiness. | Rejected interpretation. No mutation or execution permission flows from a reconciled Plan alone. |
| TC15 | Treat historical assistant Done/test/save/hash reports or a human “continue” as present verified closure/adoption (C05 reports including S039/S041/S043/S047/S056/S084/S094/S099). | O079 B1 rejects missing evidence as completion/replay authority; current Goal, E001 and actor/permission authority require checkable actual results/current delegation. | Rejected interpretation. Preserve saved reports as evidence only, not live defects, current completion proof or adopted normative Claims. |
| TC16 | Reuse the exact historical migration stage map, counts, Active/Draft exceptions and paused/remainder Task IDs (C05 reports S040–S044/S063–S067/S079–S087/S094/S099). | Current family establishes reusable mechanisms, not validity of that entire historical queue. Current P1117/P1130 govern today's retained/remainder scope; O079 B1/B2 checks validity/applicability before reuse. | Deferred historical project particulars. Any still-valid current caprmedio configuration belongs to PROJECT_CONFIGURATION after its own evidence/Plan reconciliation, not CORE Operation text. |
| TC17 | Start read-only inventory while an unrelated scope choice is pending (D05 S028/S030; resolved by S031). | The historical assistant interpretation is not blanket permission. O017 PP4/RB3 requires a ready permitted bounded item; O079 representation does not authorize its execution. This leaf has no pending inventory task to start. | Deferred specific task/admission decision. PROJECT_CONFIGURATION or the selected Plan binds permitted read-only ownership/readiness; reject any bypass of an actual blocker. |
| TC18 | Adopt neighboring Process-flow, graph-model, semantic-role or independent-review proposals merely because they occur in the cited report ranges (S042/S048/S050–S053/S062/S078/S080/S085). | These belong to separate saved candidate families/choices; C05's cited reports show handoff circumstances, not adoption of their whole semantic payload. Current Operations/Principles remain governing. | Deferred outside-family propositions. Root consolidates and binds their separate reconciliation leaves; no new CORE/PROJECT Operation or historical implementation change here. |

All eighteen rows are dispositioned: nine already-covered, three gap propositions forming one G1 family, three rejected interpretations and three deferred evidence/particulars. C05's explicit ready/owned execution, sequence, partial progress, unrelated work, validation/provenance, actual-result review/rebinding, newly required prerequisites and retained prefix are each covered. D05's human task/agent sequence, post-completion next-stage review, pending read-only interpretation and non-current-delegation boundary are each covered. TC03/TC14/TC15 make excluded interpretations explicit rather than silently adopting them.

### Destination and nonduplication decision

Reusable source destination is `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/`. Existing O017 and O079 remain canonical owners for their already-covered Claims; no duplicate selector, unfinished-work reconciler, preservation history, retry policy, completion model or dependency rule is warranted by this family.

G1 is one retained candidate capability, not three new Operations. Its proposed boundary is: consume a bounded Task's actual result and existing verification/completion evidence; assess valid remaining work and all affected dependents under current authority; reconcile only authorized changes through existing O079/Plan mechanisms; return receipt, unchanged/no-change, blocked or recovery disposition; do not authorize execution or silently change statuses. Independent review must decide whether implementation-specific additions fit O017 or whether the broader non-implementation closure/handoff Claim needs one separate Action. No new ID/carrier is allocated and no source Claim is accepted in this leaf.

The exact caprmedio migration queue, current Epic stage assignments, confidence threshold and source packet/Task IDs belong to `.../000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/003_PROJECT_CONFIGURATION/` only if a separately authorized source Operation is needed. Current P1117/P1130 already bind this Epic's execution/rebinding control. Do not duplicate their temporary Plan state as reusable normative text, and do not author the derived `00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/09_operations` Projection.

### Exact follow-up and gates

Root must carry this map into the CA-P-1130 roll-up and keep CA-P-1131 / CA-P-1156 blocked until all required reconciliation families/remainders and independent verification are complete. No parent Done claim is made.

Required bounded follow-up: independent semantic review of TC09/TC11/TC12 as the single G1 family against the complete reconciled family set and existing closure/execution authority. It must either confirm a minimal source gap and its canonical owner/domain, reject it with exact existing coverage, or defer with an explicit dependency. Only after that decision may a source-authoring leaf under CA-P-1131 bind the exact CORE source carrier and separately review it. Reuse O079 for representation repair; do not broaden its effects. Any caprmedio-specific authoring must bind PROJECT_CONFIGURATION separately. The later RMED stage must evaluate accepted changed Claims against current authority and independently disposition findings; implementation must then bind governed behavior, carriers and functional tests. None of those effects is performed or proven here.

### Current-source fingerprint receipt

The two Operations were fully read. The Goal and fourteen active Project Principles were fully read earlier in this task; all 24 retained control/carrier fingerprints were checked unchanged before reuse. P1117/P1119 were fully read; changed P1130 v3 was fully reread. Saved A916 was read only from its admitted Analysis; no native session access.

This receipt binds exact source bytes used in the comparison. The final saved-carrier gate must recheck them; changed shared parent Plans are to be reread, not overwritten. Parent integration remains root-owned.

### Verification and clock

First actual task clock: 2026-10-04 12:24:05 UTC, not reset. Saved-carrier gate clock: 2026-10-04 12:35:13 UTC, elapsed 11m08s, within the <=15-minute estimate for one assigned Agent. No overrun or recovery occurred.

Actual read-only functional gate returned PASS / exit 0: strict frontmatter (including duplicate-key rejection), registered Analysis Report type, exact Analysis/Plan headings, single Definition of Done, one EOF newline on the Analysis, eighteen ordered unique proposition IDs with all dispositions/destinations, thirty exact current-source revision/fingerprint matches, unique P1341/A1059 IDs, six-node local combined completion DAG without a cycle, and no incoming unfinished blocker of P1341. The original Plan's extra EOF blank line is normalized in its closure write. No native session, O/RMED/code/parent, Journal or Git change is part of this gate.

Closure is only this family's completed comparison. P1130 remains Active; this leaf retains BLOCKS to P1131/P1156, and root alone integrates the remaining family/review/authoring gates. Physical Done placement is under the immediate P1130 local container by D461 v6, not a parent closure or permission to execute follow-up.

## TLDR

Reuse O017/O079 for the nine already-covered propositions. Retain one generic closure-triggered receipt/review/rebinding gap family represented by three propositions for independent review; do not treat it as adopted authority. Reject three unsupported interpretations and defer three project-specific/outside-family propositions. No O, RMED, implementation, native-session, parent, Journal or Git mutation occurred.
