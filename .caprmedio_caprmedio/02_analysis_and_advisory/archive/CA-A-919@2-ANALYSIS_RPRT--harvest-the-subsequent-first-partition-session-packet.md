# Summary

Harvest the subsequent first-partition session packet

## Question

What human decisions, supersessions, reusable operational intent and assistant claims occur in the41 whole bound messages, and what exact source frontier remains?

## Scope

Exactly41 complete canonical original-main records51037–51283,20 user/21 assistant,25695raw bytes/9687content characters, all null-channel/one-part. Admitted PRIMARY session01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6; native original August22 file; frozen partition [2026-09-04T01:54:15Z,2026-09-12T01:54:15Z). Prior905v1/906v1/912v1/915v1 results supply durable context, not additional substantive coverage. No Tool/event mirrors/internal analysis/intervening ranges, external FPF sources or implementation artifacts were opened.

## Approach

Read all41 selected original byte slices and all text content in one untruncated display. Standard-library Python verified canonical response_item/message kind, raw SHA256, exact timestamp/role/null channel/one part/byte/character count, window membership and ordered aggregate. Original bytes govern; temporary910 index only retrieved next exact record boundaries.

Reread live Goalv13 and active Project Principles R819v13/R1490v1/R1407v5/R1420v5/R1421v4/R1423v4/M001v10/M002v15/M005v8/M006v8/M261v5/E001v12; actor/permission P032v5/P033v9/P034v6; authoritative source Plan R1589v4/R1580v4/D460v6/D470v7/D481v4. Source bodies under000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources govern, not projections. Epic1117v1/parent1126v6/1200v1 and affected1119v1/1130v1/1155v1 were reread. No governing revision change was encountered. Current inherited90% threshold remains; source historical100% governs only its original clarification exchange.

Preserve literal short replies with their complete immediate questions and explicit later corrections. Separate human intent, assistant recommendation, assistant interpretation, reported reading/FPF diagnosis and actual verification. Findings/fixes in915 stay scoped to their report; later human choices below resolve historical directions without proving corresponding implementation.

## Results

### Human decisions, antecedents and supersession

There are20 intentional human messages and16 traceable groups:15 settled control/semantic directions and1 clarification group whose revised relocation question remains unanswered. Query/correction groups are retained rather than counted as independent approval of every assistant statement.

- D01 — M01/51037 literal `ask me questions one 1 by 1 to fix all\nconfidence threshold 100%\n` requests sequential issue resolution for the immediately preceding915 report. M02 promises no changes until material decisions are explicit. This historical100% supersedes the earlier99% for this later exchange only; it does not overwrite Epic1117's current90% or give this harvest worker repair authority. No apply-all/save instruction or repair outcome appears inside this packet.
- D02 — M03/51049 literal `yes\n` approves M02/51042: `SUBTYPE_OF` means every Entity classified by A is also classified by B; Atom/Artifact is an example. D05 subsequently replaces the relation name with SUBKIND_OF while retaining the proposed taxonomy/inclusion distinction.
- D03 — M05/51061 literal `yes\n` approves M04/51054: every Property A occurrence belongs to exactly one B-classified bearer occurrence and cannot occur independently. D07 andD10 later specify qualified Property endpoints and direct cardinality; do not conflate occurrence bearing with reusable Term identity.
- D04 — M07/51073 literal `yes\n` approves M06/51066: A is a permitted value of Property B without asserting any Entity currently has that value. D08/D11 later qualify the value Subject and cardinality.
- D05 — M09/51085 literal `any better option? subtype/type is too similar? we have "type" as more narrow meaning (Conten role: Analysis/Type: Rationale)\n` challenges M08's SUBTYPE_OF/Type wording; it is not approval of M08. M11/51099 literal `yes, subkind is better\n` approves revised M10/51092: SUBKIND_OF for taxonomy between Terms; Type stays a narrow, single-valued Property within a Subject Path, with Atom/Projection/Scope Unit taxonomy examples and Type: Rationale/Ordered examples. This later explicit taxonomy choice supersedes906 D03's earlier no-subtypes direction within this historical target; the renamed subkind formulation is the accepted distinction. Present authority/adoption still requires1130.
- D06 — M13/51111 literal `It's one Term, but different dependent entities (properties) - \nContent Role: Analysis/Type\nContent Role: Requirement/Type\nScope Unit/Type\n` clarifies M12's complete-path Property identity: reusable Type Term is one; Properties differ. M15/51121 literal `Term should be used coherently in all cases, in the same meaning\n` constrains M14's interpretation and proposed domains. M17/51133 literal `yes\n` approves revised M16/51126: Type means a single-valued Property whose value classifies its bearer within the allowed set for its complete Subject Path; only bearer/values differ. Per-path <=1 is assistant supporting interpretation consistent with this approved single-valued meaning, not global Term cardinality.
- D07 — M19/51145 literal `yes\n` approves M18/51138: IS_BORNE_BY applies to the path-qualified Property, not reusable leaf Term; example Content Role: Analysis/Type to Content Role: Analysis. No global Type IS_BORNE_BY Analysis claim.
- D08 — M21/51157 literal `yes\n` approves M20/51150: IS_ALLOWED_VALUE_OF uses fully qualified value Subject, not reusable value Term alone; example Content Role: Analysis/Type: Rationale to Content Role: Analysis/Type. This supersedes M14's unapproved allowed-value Term endpoint proposal. A reused Draft Term can occur in distinct qualified Status domains with coherent meaning.
- D09 — M23/51169 literal `for now any Term can have any number of subkind_of parents.\nit can be useful to set "terb C = term A x term B"\n` rejects M22/51162's <=1-parent forest/no-multiple-inheritance recommendation. M25/51181 literal `yes of course\n` approves revised M24/51174: every C is both A and B; it does not require C to equal the full intersection and does not create Cartesian-product pairs. Preserve the provisional phrase for now, the source typo and the clarified meaning; do not infer pair construction from the informal x.
- D10 — M27/51193 literal `yes\n` approves M26/51186: every qualified Property has exactly one direct IS_BORNE_BY bearer; reusable Type Term is not itself a Property and obtains a bearer only through a Subject Path use.
- D11 — M29/51205 literal `yes, exactly one\n` approves M28/51198: each fully qualified allowed-value Subject has exactly one direct IS_ALLOWED_VALUE_OF Property; reusable Rationale can appear in other paths without sharing this relation occurrence.
- D12 — M31/51217 literal `project is unordered, don't see any issues, we can don't break the law here\n` rejects M30/51210's Project root/no-Type exception. M32's every-Scope-Unit exactly-one Type/Project Unordered is supporting interpretation. This explicitly selects the Project ordering alternative instead of915 FX003's preferred exception; no current carrier edit is proved.
- D13 — M33/51231 literal `yes\n` approves M32/51224: Activity exists only for an Artifact whose qualified type defines Status. Atoms/Epics may have derived Activity; Journals/Projections/Scope Units/Settings get none unless their own Status model is introduced. This answers915 DC004/GAP003's universal-versus-subset direction without inventing non-Atom Status values.
- D14 — M35/51243 literal `yes\n` approves M34/51236: for each status-bearing Artifact, Activity Active when Status Active and Inactive for every other allowed Status. The domain restriction D13 is retained.
- D15 — M37/51255 literal `yes, the core is the core\n` approves M36/51248: CORE_META_MODEL admission needs generic-model representation/extension/configuration/validation/compilation necessity; variable concrete defaults/reporting/optional views/implementation-tier policies belong to LOCAL_CONFIGURATION. This approves an admission distinction, not exact relocation of any named Atom.
- D16 — M39/51267 has an annotation transport wrapper selecting `Should all concrete silent/verbose reporting-mode`, source messageId `msg_01b0e190a14510bc016a9ad6ccfb1487d2861b5d7aadd09aa8`, offsets41–91, and literal human request `what's this\n`. The wrapper directs annotation handling but is machine/copied context, not a separate human choice. It asks for explanation of M38/51260's proposed reporting-mode move to LOCAL_CONFIGURATION, not approval. M40 reports checking active authority. M41/51283 explains the setting, then revises Question17 to Framework Engine/settings instead of LOCAL_CONFIGURATION. That revised destination is assistant-origin/unapproved at this packet's final record; next51290 must be bound to this full835-character antecedent. No current harvest Question is created merely for this preserved historical open question.

The report's six DC/FX pairs are not wholesale accepted as written: D05/D06/D07/D08/D09/D10/D11 select precise graph/Property semantics; D12 chooses a different Project ordering resolution; D13/D14 choose a lifecycle subset; D15 establishes Core admission. Exact repair/re-evaluation, full615-Atom audit, named destination/consumer compatibility and remaining claim split work stay unproved/deferred. Prior915 GAP001/GAP004 are not closed by these answers. Later human supersession may occur after this packet.

### Provisional reusable candidate groups

These are4 grouped intents for later1130 reconciliation, not4 newly adopted Operations. Generic behaviors provisionally belong to CORE_META_MODEL; project paths, concrete setting policy, report/tool implementation and actual relocation destinations require their own current authority/configuration.

- OP01 — resolve material choices one at a time with exact antecedent, coherent literal correction and scoped confidence control before mutation. D01/D05/D06/D09/D12/D16 demonstrate rejected/revised questions and short approvals. Reconcile with906 OP02/915 OP02; historical100% is not a universal default. The unresolved Question17 is retained as a frontier, not bypassed by a prior general yes.
- OP02 — evaluate graph/lifecycle semantics over exact qualified candidate domains, distinguishing reusable Term, dependent Property/value Subject, current assignment, multiple-parent entailment and explicit Status-bearing Activity. D02–D14 supply human semantic directions and negative examples. Reconcile with906 OP03/915 OP01; these ontology decisions are domain content for review/verification, not a new workflow per primitive/cardinality.
- OP03 — check generic Core necessity and explain exact active behavior before proposing a receiving authority. D15/D16 andM40/M41 supply human admission intent and assistant source-check/explanation proposal. Reconcile with915 OP03 and912 OP04/OP06; variable product policy is not automatically LOCAL_CONFIGURATION, as M41's later unapproved Engine/settings alternative shows. Exact destination is not yet adopted.
- OP04 — preserve evidence type, temporal authorization, explicit supersession and unanswered frontier across report, decision, proposed implementation and review. D01–D16/EV01 show human choices without implementation proof and a latest revised question. Reconcile with906 OP01/OP06/915 OP04; save/read/test/FPF claims need independent native artifact/Tool evidence before reliance as execution proof.

### Assistant claims and stop-state disposition

M02–M38 are assistant questions/interpretations, not independently adopted methodology. Accepted questions are paired above with exact human replies; rejected and unanswered variants remain visible. M14's proposed relation domains were not approved as stated; later D07/D08 qualify them. M24's acceptance of unlimited parents andM32's universal ordering interpretation do not prove source mutation.

EV01/M40–M41 reports checking an existing active Core Atom and explains interaction.reporting_mode in Framework Instance Settings, silent/verbose values, default silent, progress presentation, mandatory blocker/failure/approval/safety reporting, one shared setting for Skills/Tools, and presentation-only/non-effect on authorization/routing/validation/safety. M41 reports FPF criticism as concrete product interaction policy and several independently changeable claims. These are historical assistant source-read/diagnosis claims; no exact Atom ID, opened carrier, Tool output, validation, save receipt, Git/test result or completed implementation occurs in this packet. They add no independent current authority. Revised Engine/settings relocation remains open. No historical STOP marker or repair-complete declaration occurs.

No current harvest blocker, incompatible current authority or unresolved autonomous choice was encountered. Existing C293 retains root full-parser/environment ownership; nonblocking C294 keeps unasserted broader candidate identity. Historical questions/proposals/defects are evidence dispositions and do not alone establish current Concerns. No new Concern was needed.

### Verification and affected readiness

Observed input verification passed41 whole slices and ordered aggregate, exact metadata/sizes/all text parts,20user/21assistant. Next1204 binding passed100 raw slice/metadata/part checks and aggregate; completed51283 context and following52093 were separately checked. These are integrity/binding checks, not future substantive harvest. Saved-output verification, actual elapsed and result are recorded in1200 before Done. Root owns strict YAML/full-Epic DAG and authorized saving underC293; no unsupported full-parser/save-Tool claim is made.
