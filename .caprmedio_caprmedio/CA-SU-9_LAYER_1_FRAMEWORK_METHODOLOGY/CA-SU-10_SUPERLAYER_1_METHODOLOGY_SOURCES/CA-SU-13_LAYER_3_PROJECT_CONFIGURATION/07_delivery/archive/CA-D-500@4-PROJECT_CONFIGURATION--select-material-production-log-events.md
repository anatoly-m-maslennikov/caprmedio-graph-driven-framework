# Summary

Select material production log events

## Scope

production log emission under Logging Policies for production-relevant components.

## Claim

production logs record material state transitions **and** boundary outcomes; ordinary internal ticks do **not** define routine production log events.

## Details

the selection preserves material operational evidence **without** treating **every** internal tick as a production event.
