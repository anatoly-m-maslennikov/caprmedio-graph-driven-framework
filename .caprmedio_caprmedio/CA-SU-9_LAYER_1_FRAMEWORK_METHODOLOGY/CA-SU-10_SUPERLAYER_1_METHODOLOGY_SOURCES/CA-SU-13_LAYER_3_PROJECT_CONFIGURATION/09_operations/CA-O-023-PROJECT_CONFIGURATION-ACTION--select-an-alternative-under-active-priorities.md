# Summary

Select an alternative under active priorities

## Operation

Select Priority-Governed Alternative **means** the Action that applies resolved Operator priorities **to** candidate alternatives **and** returns a justified selection **or** an unresolved comparison.

### execution

1. obtain the effective priorities resolved under CA-O-022 for the affected context. unresolved priorities do **not** authorize selection.
2. reject **every** candidate that violates applicable authority **or** a non-negotiable constraint.
3. apply the selected model **to** the remaining alternatives using the available evidence. use CA-M-297 **only** for Operator-selected comparison by priority order; use the selected technique for another model.
4. return a selected alternative **only** **when** that model justifies the choice. retain the constraints, criterion evidence, **and** comparison result that justify it.

### unresolved comparison

**if** no admissible alternative remains **or** the model does **not** determine a selection:

- report the alternatives, constraints, evidence, **and** unresolved comparison **to** the Operator.
- identify incomplete criterion order, unresolved ties, **or** incomparable results **when** applicable.
- do **not** invent a tie-break, substitute an algorithm, **or** return an unsupported winner.

**if** the Operator changes the applicable priorities, use the newly resolved result under CA-O-022 **before** comparing again.
