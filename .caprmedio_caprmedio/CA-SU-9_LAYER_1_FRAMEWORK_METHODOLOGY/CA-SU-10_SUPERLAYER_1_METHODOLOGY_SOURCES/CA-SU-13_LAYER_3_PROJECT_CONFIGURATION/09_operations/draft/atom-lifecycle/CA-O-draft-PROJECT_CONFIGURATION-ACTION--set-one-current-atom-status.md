## Summary

Set one Current Atom Status

## Claim scope

One exact non-container Current Atom and one requested Status in its qualified model's Current group.

## Claim

Set the selected Current Atom's Status to the supplied value allowed by its applicable Current status model. Derive carrier location; preserve Version and Updated At. Report an explicit error on failure. Journal business observations are independent and nonblocking.

For missing or invalid input format or allowed value, give a short explanation and request an additional input dictionary. Wait for it; the caller may cancel while waiting, without interrupting an Action.

### Outputs

`savedCurrentAtom` a request for additional input, or an explicit failure; any Journal warning is separate.
