## Summary

Preserve terminal Workflow handoff approval boundaries

## Claim scope

a terminal Workflow handoff from an Agentic Step Invocation.

## Claim

a terminal Workflow handoff **must** end the predecessor Run **and** let the executor admit a separate successor under `CA-R-1520-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--return-workflow-handoffs-through-terminal-results`. a session instruction **must not** silently resume an ended Run **or** bypass approval.
