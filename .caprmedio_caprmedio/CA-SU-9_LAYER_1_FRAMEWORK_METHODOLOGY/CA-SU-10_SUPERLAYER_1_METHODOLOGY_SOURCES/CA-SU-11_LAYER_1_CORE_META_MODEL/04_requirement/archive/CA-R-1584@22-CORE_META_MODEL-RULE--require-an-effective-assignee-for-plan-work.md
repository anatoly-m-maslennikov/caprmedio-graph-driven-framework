## Summary

Require an effective Assignee for Plan work

## Claim scope

Plan Atoms with their own work content, excluding pure Hubs **without** their own work.

## Claim

**every** Plan Atom with its own work content **must** have **`=1`** effective Assignee; a pure Hub **without** its own work does **not** require an additional Assignee merely because it organizes other Plans.
