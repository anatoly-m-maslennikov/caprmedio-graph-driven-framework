# Summary

Gate governing Atom changes during implementation

## Scope

changes to governing RMED Atoms during implementation.

## Claim

authorization **to** change a governing RMED Atom during implementation **must** satisfy the following Actor policy:

- resolve the Atom's effective Author **before** the proposed change, its governing permissions, the effective Plan Autonomous Confidence Threshold under CA-R-1591, **and** **all** additional Operator rules.
- obtain Operator approval **before** changing an Operator-authored Atom.
- request Operator disposition **before** changing an AI-authored Atom **when** confidence is below the threshold **or** an additional rule requires approval.
- an AI-authored Atom **may** change autonomously **only** **when** confidence is at **or** above the threshold **and** **all** applicable permissions **and** Operator rules allow it.
- a prohibition remains a prohibition; authorship **or** confidence **must not** create permission.
- a missing **or** unresolved Author **must not** be treated as proof of AI authorship; apply the Author default under CA-R-1080.
- an authorized RMED change establishes a new baseline under CA-M-262, **and** the applicable work **and** Evaluations **must** be resolved again against it.
