# Summary

Define Specification Content Roles

## Scope

Specification Content Roles (Spec, RMED).

## Claim

Specification Content Roles (Spec, RMED) **means** the set (Requirement, Method, Evaluation, Delivery) that specifies governed content **and** Entities, including CAPO **and** I.

## Details

- Requirement establishes required outcomes and runtime behavior, including functional and non-functional requirements, and the methodology's own model definitions and constraints.
- Method establishes how those outcomes are achieved, including architecture, coding policies, engineering decisions, construction and authorship conventions.
- Evaluation establishes correctness checks.
- Delivery establishes Carrier contents, representation, **and** placement.

The methodology's own model and specification content are also within this specification domain; RMED is not limited to native Implementation. Subject and Content Role are independent: any RMED Role can govern a Domain, Engineering or global Graph Subject.
