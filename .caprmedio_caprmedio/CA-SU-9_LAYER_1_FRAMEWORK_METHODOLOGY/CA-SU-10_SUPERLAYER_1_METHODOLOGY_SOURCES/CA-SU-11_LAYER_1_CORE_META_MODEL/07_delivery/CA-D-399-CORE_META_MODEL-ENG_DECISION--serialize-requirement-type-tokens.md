## Summary

Serialize Requirement Type Tokens

## Claim scope

the serialization of Requirement Type tokens in a Requirement Atom File Carrier filename.

## Claim

a Requirement Atom File Carrier **must** serialize its effective Label within the Atom filename grammar governed by CA-D-283 and CA-D-284, using the explicit Label when present and the Type name when Label is absent. The effective Label is normalized as an uppercase structured token; an unlabeled Constraint and Boundary therefore use `CONSTRAINT` and `BOUNDARY`. This generic rule covers every admitted Requirement Type and does not rename a Type, admit a new Type, or prescribe a YAML Type value.
