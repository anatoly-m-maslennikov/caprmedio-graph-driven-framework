# Summary

Serialize Project-Owned Markdown Atom Filenames

## Scope

Identified Project-owned Markdown Atom filenames other than Plan filenames governed by CA-D-469.

## Claim

**every** identified Project-owned Markdown Atom filename other than a Plan filename governed by CA-D-469 **must** match `<ATOM_ID>[-<CURRENT_SCOPE>][-<LOCAL_TIER>][-<ATOM_TYPE>][-<TARGET_SCOPE>]--<SUMMARY_SLUG>.<EXT>`. serialize the `ATOM_TYPE` segment **only** **when** the Atom carries a Type under CA-D-276; an omitted Type has no filename segment. **every** same-identity Atom Revision **must** preserve its exact assigned Atom-ID segment **in** its Carrier filename **and** serialize its retained Summary under CA-D-282. A Draft filename uses the Draft marker as its Atom-ID segment as specified by CA-D-650. An Archived predecessor uses `<canonical-ID>@<old-version>` exactly once in that segment under CA-D-289; do not append a duplicate version suffix. Existing legacy archive filenames are not normalized automatically. a replacement filename **must** contain the successor Atom ID **and** the successor's Summary Slug; a Summary Slug **must not** be edited independently of its source Summary.
