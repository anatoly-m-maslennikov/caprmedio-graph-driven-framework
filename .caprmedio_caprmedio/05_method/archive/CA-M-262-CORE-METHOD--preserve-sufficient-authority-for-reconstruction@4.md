# Preserve sufficient authority for reconstruction

**to** rebuild the Implementation, use the current RMED as sufficient authority for reproducing its required behavior **and** passing its applicable Evaluations **without** the previous Implementation **or** additional specification preparation; **if** the implementation language changes, **then** update the affected Method **and** Delivery authority **before** rebuilding against the resulting current RMED. a ready-made alternative Implementation is **not** required.

under unchanged governing RMED, reconstruct runtime behavior that produces the same output for the same complete runtime input, including relevant starting state, configuration, time, randomness, **and** external-service responses. preserve the applicable Method **and** Delivery constraints; identical source code **or** identical source-file bytes are **not** required. judge fresh reconstruction **and** repeated implementation by this runtime equivalence, **not** by a requirement **to** leave already-conforming code untouched. an authorized RMED change establishes a new comparison baseline **and** **must not** be reported as reconstruction against unchanged RMED.
