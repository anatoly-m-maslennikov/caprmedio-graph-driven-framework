# Summary

Normalize O052 source Carrier headings without changing resolver behavior

## Concern

The current authoritative O052 v4 source uses a legacy title and lacks the literal Operations body headings required by D479 v6. This is a saved Carrier-format Problem, not evidence that its resolver semantics are absent or a permission to change settings. P1343 authorizes reconciliation only; source editing is outside this leaf.

## Evidences

Fully read source `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/CA-O-052-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--resolve-project-and-framework-settings-before-derived-structure.md`, v4, updated2026-09-17 05:05:05 +0000, SHA256 `d3ef6100f15a2405d166c99b01c87905034729370fc734824dd845b66f257b90`. Its sole level-one heading is `# Resolve Project and Framework Settings before derived structure`; it has no level-two headings.

Fully read D479 v6 source, SHA256 `0819f8433cde89484e21a200466504a9fdcad31b58958c777a761637fbb45ff1`: every Markdown Operations Carrier must contain exactly one `# Summary`, then exactly one `## Operation` and `## Details`. A missing heading cannot be inferred from prose or position.

A1061's semantic comparison covers ten saved candidate propositions and six resolver clauses without modifying O052. Resolve this Problem only after an authorized source-authoring task normalizes those headings, preserves behavior/identity and obtains independent review plus the applicable governed save proof. Historical reports are not that proof.

## Blast radius

Only the authoritative O052 Carrier's registered Main Content property boundaries and downstream readers depending on those exact headings. No behavior gap, settings mutation, secret/runtime authorization, new Operation identity, Project Configuration owner or repository-wide formatting audit is asserted. Parent authoring/review gates own resolution; P1343 can complete its bounded reconciliation while this source-format follow-up remains unresolved.
