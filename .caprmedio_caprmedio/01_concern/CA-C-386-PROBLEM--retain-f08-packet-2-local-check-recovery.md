# Summary

Retain F08 packet 2 local check recovery

## Concern

Non-blocking execution evidence: the first local completeness-check attempt assumed root Principle YAML carried `atom_id`; those known Principle identities are filename-bound. The resulting diagnostic failure is not evidence of a methodology defect. Correct only this in-memory check and retain the original actual clock; no shared diagnostic or source edit is authorized.

## Evidences

P1412 started at 2026-10-04 13:35:33 UTC. At 13:47:49 UTC the host check returned exit 1 / `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'` while attempting the Principle identity lookup, before the strict carrier gate. Its already-passed eighteen-reference, unique-ID, EOF and source-revision assertions were not a completed gate. Earlier sequence-prefix lookup and verbose-display mistakes were recovered by exact bounded rereads. The same in-memory gate, corrected to use the known root Principle filenames, passed / exit 0 at 13:49:33 UTC. A1132 retains that separate outcome; no failed diagnostic is relabeled as a pass. This Concern remains retained non-blocking recovery evidence, not missing leaf work.

## Blast radius

Done physical placement/readback was verified at 13:50:40 UTC, 15m07s after the original start: a minor terminal-save/readback overrun, truthfully retained without expanding the leaf or resetting its clock.

Only local execution-evidence completeness is affected. No native/raw evidence was read, source authority changed, parent mutated, runtime tested, Git/Journal written or first clock reset. This Concern retains a recovered execution issue, not a new candidate or current source-coverage gap.
