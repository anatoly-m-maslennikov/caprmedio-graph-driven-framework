# Summary

Restore the authoring bundle closure

## Concern

the completed source-authoring child bundle cannot be relocated to its parent's `done/` directory because the filesystem denies the directory rename.

## Evidences

- source: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/03_plan/15-CA-P-1117-EPIC--harvest-and-implement-session-derived-operations/02-CA-P-1119-TASK--reconcile-and-author-methodology-operations/02-CA-P-1131-TASK--author-one-methodology-operation-slice`.
- requested destination: the same parent's `done/02-CA-P-1131-TASK--author-one-methodology-operation-slice`.
- the original rename and the unchanged retry returned `Operation not permitted`; the last observed failure preceded this receipt at 2026-10-04 15:34:45 +0000. read-only inspection showed ordinary owner permissions, no immutable flags, and the retained fifteen Done child Plans. the exact cause is not established.
- P1131's Markdown Carrier had moved separately. it is now restored beside the unchanged bundle with Active status. source authoring and all fifteen child results remain retained; no completed source result is revoked or claimed independently reviewed.

## Blast radius

CA-P-1131's physical paired closure remains unresolved. The subsequent explicit Operator scope amendment in CA-P-1117 v3 excludes that legacy authoring closure from required delivery and removes its gates on the newly selected source frontier; this Concern is now nonblocking for the amended Epic. The selected sources still require independent review. No directory relocation, permission bypass or repair is claimed. Resolution of this retained physical-placement defect still requires the exact paired relocation to succeed within authorized permissions.
