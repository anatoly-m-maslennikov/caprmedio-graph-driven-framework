# Summary

Bring short-name screening carrier to current headings

## Concern

Current authoritative CA-O-065 v5 lacks the exact registered Operations body headings required by current CA-D-479 v6. Its screening behavior is substantively covered, including explicit acceptance of warned names, but current registered-carrier conformance cannot be claimed until the owned source is migrated and independently checked.

## Evidences

Full O065 v5 was read during P1344 at the exact CORE_META_MODEL source `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/CA-O-065-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--screen-short-names-for-unintended-readings.md`; 1267 bytes, SHA256 `b3bda51511a83837c6f08ff4e90270774b7a400001484afa410d48375f416a06`. Its sole body heading is `# Screen short names for unintended readings`, followed by a lead, three bullets and a closing sentence. It contains zero literal `# Summary`, `## Operation` and `## Details` headings.

Full current CA-D-479 v6 requires exactly one `# Summary` and, for Operations, exactly one `## Operation` followed by `## Details`. Its fingerprint is retained with O065 and all current controls in CA-A-1062. This is an observed source/registered-carrier mismatch, not an inference from a projection, old agent report or runtime test. The one saved-carrier proof at2026-10-04 12:35:34UTC confirmed the observed mismatch and this typed active Concern's strict YAML/registered headings.

## Blast radius

The discrepancy affects authoritative O065's body-property addressability and independent source review, not the existence of its warning/alternative/explicit-acceptance behavior. P1344 may finish its bounded semantic reconciliation with this issue preserved; P1131/P1156 source authoring/review must arrange the narrow source-carrier repair and verify registered headings without changing the existing semantics. No O/RMED/code/parent/Journal/Git changes were made here, and no automatic rejection of Operator-accepted warned names is authorized. Resolution requires a separately authorized source edit and independent registered-carrier check; this Concern remains active.
