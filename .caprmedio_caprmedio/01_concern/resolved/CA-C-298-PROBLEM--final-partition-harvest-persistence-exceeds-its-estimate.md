# Summary

Final-partition harvest persistence exceeds its estimate

## Concern

1193's hundred selected messages were fully read,but root coordination/context continuation delayed durable output beyond the original fifteen-minute estimate. Complete semantic reading is not sufficient to mark1193 Done while persistence/verification remains unfinished.

## Evidences

1193 was executing before root's2026-10-04T04:17:57Z clock; the first retained incomplete persistence clock is04:22:58Z. Exact working-time accounting was not measured; do not claim an exact elapsed pass. Root binds remaining save/check work as actual child1207 with a <=5-minute estimate and records actual results before closure. Selected100raw aggregate0a983c5940b3f1e608b44c9d2b88383fe2d6c7de03a7289152a3423f7f95bdc1 is independently reverified; no lost source fragment is asserted.

Only1193 persistence and its next1203 readiness. Parent1129/1118 remain Active; no authoring/implementation gate is released. Resolution requires saving/verifying the bound remainder,not a false timing receipt or reprocessing an unchanged source.
