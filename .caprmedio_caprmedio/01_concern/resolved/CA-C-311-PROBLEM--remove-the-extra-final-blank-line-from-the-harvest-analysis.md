# Summary

Remove the extra final blank line from the harvest Analysis

## Concern

The staged A987 Carrier still had an extra final blank line despite its prior single-EOF check claim.

## Evidences

Actual staged diff check exited2 and named A987 line443. Root removed only the extra trailing blank line, refreshed Updated At and preserved Version1/native content/decisions. The repeat staged check passed before actual624b0cc0b save. That commit's16currentCarrierstates matched Git/savedbytes and sealed recoveredJournal events; ownedstates251.

## Blast radius

A987 formatting only; no sourcecoverage, current source Atom, implementation or unrelated edits changed.
