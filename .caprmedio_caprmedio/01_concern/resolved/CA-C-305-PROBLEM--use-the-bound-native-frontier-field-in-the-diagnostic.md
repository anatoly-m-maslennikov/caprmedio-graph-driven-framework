# Summary

Use the bound native frontier field in the diagnostic

## Concern

The P1284 provenance diagnostic used first_native instead of the bundle schema's actual first field for its final frontier assertion.

## Evidences

All preceding native snapshots/messages/parts/context, saved100dispositions, current/next binding and disjointness assertions passed before KeyError. The caller was corrected to first/path, and the exact frontier bytes passed at07:48:30Z. No binding, evidence or implementation bytes were changed. Strict127Plans/69supportingCarriers and whitespace passed; finalsavedreceipt07:48:31Z remains within the07:49:50deadline.

## Blast radius

Only this temporary diagnostic invocation. No source failure, fabricated coverage or need to implement a framework Tool.
