# Summary

Second-partition harvest closure exceeds its estimate

## Concern

The1210 agent completed99-message substantive verification within13m49s, but final carrier closure returned after15m04s. The current Plan says a leaf exceeding15minutes needs bounded unfinished work; its Done timestamp recorded only substantive completion. Preserve the valid harvest and actual four-second overrun, but complete the closure in an explicit bounded child rather than silently treating13m49s as final closure.

## Evidences

The agent reports start2026-10-04T05:00:47Z, substantive verification05:14:36Z, and terminal closure05:15:51Z. A928v1 contains99 full fingerprints/dispositions,nine historical choices/seven provisional groups and exact next1214/A932 binding. No missing source content is inferred. Root retains1210 as composite Active and binds1217,estimate<=5minutes, to saved-output/frontier/placement/DAG checks only; no source rereview or new methodology/implementation work.

## Blast radius

Resolved after actual1217 verification05:25:27Z:99saved whole identities/parts/dispositions and95next input identities/context/budget/frontier match native evidence; strict carrier/full-DAG checks pass.1217 and1210 composite/child bundle move Done. Original15m04s preserved. Closure itself took7m23s, exceeding its5minute estimate but within the15minute Epic bound.1214ready;1127/1118Active and downstream stages still blocked. No source findings discarded or newly adopted.

Only1210 closure and readiness of1214/1119/1130/1155.1127/1118 remain Active; other independent packets are unaffected. Resolve after actual1217 checks, documented terminal result and correct parent/child Done placements, preserving the original overrun.
