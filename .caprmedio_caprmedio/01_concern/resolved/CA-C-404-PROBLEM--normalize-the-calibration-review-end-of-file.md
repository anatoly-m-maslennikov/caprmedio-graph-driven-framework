# Summary

Normalize the calibration review end of file

## Concern

the scoped save check found an extra empty line at the end of the calibration review Carrier.

## Evidences

`git diff --cached --check` identified the extra line in CA-A-1085-ANALYSIS_RPRT--review-calibration-and-legacy-preparation-gaps. removed that line and refreshed Updated At; Summary, Version and meaning remain unchanged. the repeated scoped check supplies the save gate.

## Blast radius

formatting of this Analysis Carrier only; no source Operation, authority or runtime change.
