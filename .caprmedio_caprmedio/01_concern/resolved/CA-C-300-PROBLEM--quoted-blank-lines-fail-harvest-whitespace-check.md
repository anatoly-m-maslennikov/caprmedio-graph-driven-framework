# Summary

Quoted blank lines fail harvest whitespace check

## Concern

The staged save check found24 quoted blank lines with trailing spaces in A940. Commit was stopped, rather than treating that failing check as a pass.

## Evidences

The staged check identified24 lines from430 to499. Mechanical formatting removed the spaces after the quote marker; A940 updated_at changed, Version stayed1 because no meaning or native evidence changed. All125 row dispositions, complete native text and fingerprints remain intact. Subsequent staged whitespace and strict-carrier checks passed before actual checkpointcommit a25e687d7. This Concern's direct concern_about relation now binds A940 as required by the Epic; the resolved disposition is unchanged.

## Blast radius

Only A940's quoted blank-line formatting is affected. Its completed native harvest and observed leaf timing are not recounted. No O/RMED, source session, settings, implementation or unrelated dirty carrier is changed.
