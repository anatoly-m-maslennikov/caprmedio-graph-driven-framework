# Summary

Remove preflight plan trailing whitespace

## Concern

eight bound formatting Plans carry trailing spaces in their preservation paragraph. the root save sequence continued after the whitespace check reported them.

## Evidences

commit 77df07480 retained the exact prepared Plans despite the nonzero whitespace check; no passing result is claimed for that original check. the active writers or root removed the spaces from all eight stable saved Plans, preserving Summary, meaning and Version and refreshing Updated At. the repeated scoped `git diff --check` then exited zero before authoring-parent closure.

## Blast radius

Plan formatting and the root save gate only. all worker proofs and source changes remain preserved. future save sequences stop on a failed check rather than continuing to commit it as if verified.
