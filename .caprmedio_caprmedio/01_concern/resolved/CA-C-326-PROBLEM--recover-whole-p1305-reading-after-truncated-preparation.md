# Summary

Recover whole P1305 reading after truncated preparation.

## Concern

Bundled preliminary reads exceeded transport output and a preparation extractor printed the large context collection before a KeyError from using contexts instead of context_only_messages. No truncated response was credited as whole antecedent reading or semantic coverage.

## Evidences

Actual execution started2026-10-04 10:27:31UTC. Oversized initial parent/leaf/predecessor outputs were incomplete; full parent was subsequently read gaplessly in[0,16000),[16000,32000),[32000,48000),[48000,66137). Complete61633audit was reread in[0,16000),[16000,32000),[32000,48000),[48000,61287); all ten current/context parts were read fully. Corrected extractor uses exact live keycontext_only_messages and excludes native fences from prose reads. Fresh frozen-prefix/raw/native-part/metadata/aggregate proof passed before persistence; saved/Carrier/localDAGproof remains pending. No source content was modified and no original clock was reset.

### Resolution receipt

Complete bounded rereading and native/saved equality recovered the incomplete preparation. Eleven strict Carriers and the nine-Plan local DAG pass; current and future coverage remain separate. The first closure patch was rejected atomically because its header hunks were out of document order; no partial mutation occurred, and the corrected ordered patch preserves this actual failure here. Resolution clock 2026-10-04 10:39:35 +0000; original first clock 2026-10-04 10:27:31 UTC remains unchanged. Final Done/resolved placement and persisted terminal receipt are checked next; no runtime/environment repair occurred.

### Full terminal receipt

Full terminal clock after saved proof, physical Done/resolved placement and persisted closure checks: 2026-10-04 10:40:32 UTC. Original first clock 2026-10-04 10:27:31 UTC was never reset; elapsed 13m01s, within the <=15-minute estimate, including authority/whole-source reading, transport/schema recovery, rejected atomic closure patch, persistence and local checks. Eight new records give 719/1869 refined coverage, 1150 refined and 1158 original records remaining. P1305 is physically Done; C326 is physically resolved; P1126 and P1310 are Active. P1310/A1028 binding contributes zero semantic coverage. All other corpus/frontier and downstream gates remain. Root global strict/save/Git/Journal work is separate; this Agent holds after P1305.

## Blast radius

This leaf's preparation transport and accountable elapsed time only. It does not change source semantics, historical decisions, coverage denominators or current authority. Resolve only after complete native/saved/provenance and final placement proof; retain any actual overrun in this same Concern.
