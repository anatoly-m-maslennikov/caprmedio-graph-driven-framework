# Summary

Checker separation closure exceeds its estimate

## Concern

P1303's actual closure exceeded its <=15-minute estimate. Retain the original 09:49:19 UTC first clock, disclose the actual duration, and finish only the saved closure recovery against the actual completion requirements. This active Problem is nonblocking for proved output and downstream readiness after P1303 is Done: it records execution timing rather than a missing source, unverified disposition or authorization gap. Do not claim timely completion or reset the start.

## Evidences

At 2026-10-04 10:00 UTC, the invocation returned `.venv/bin/python: No such file or directory`; the checkout's `.venv/bin` is empty. Host Python also returned `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`. No source or environment was changed by either attempt.

The existing cached PyYAML package at `/Users/am/.cache/uv/archive-v0/EvRMVz-hAg6EYUtr/yaml` is the safe read-only recovery candidate. Use host Python with that parent directory added only to this process's import search. No installation, Docker or service operation is needed. Resolution requires the original complete saved/native/current-source/Carrier/local-DAG proof to pass, followed by truthful physical Done/terminal checks within the original 09:49:19 UTC start.

### Timing evidence and disposition

The complete original proof passed at 10:02:29 UTC, including the full frozen prefix, fifty native/saved parts and dispositions, exact current-next binding, twenty-two governing sources, Carrier checks and nine local Plan nodes. Persistence at 10:05:20 UTC and terminal observation at 10:05:22 UTC yielded 963.49 seconds from the original start, exceeding the estimate by 63.49 seconds. The terminal elapsed<=900 assertion failed; every preceding completion and placement assertion had passed. It incorrectly treated actual elapsed time as a hard completion requirement rather than distinguishing bounded estimate from disclosed overrun.

The earlier interpreter/YAML availability issue is resolved through read-only cached-PyYAML use. This reopened Concern retains that history and the actual timing failure. The affected work is a saved closure recovery only; full proved harvest coverage is retained. Finish its required-output/current-next/physical-Done/local-gate checks, save the real terminal elapsed time, then hold. The overrun remains recorded as an active nonblocking process issue for future estimate calibration.

### Saved closure recovery receipt

Required-output/strict owned Carrier/current-next/physical Done/local-DAG proof passed at 2026-10-04 10:09:37 UTC, 1218.95 seconds from the original 09:49:19 UTC start, exceeding the estimate by 318.95 seconds. P1303 is physically Done, P1128 and the actual next remain Active, A1025 remains reserved unused, and C322 remains active/nonblocking with the overrun disclosed. The full frozen-prefix/native/saved proof remains the single 10:02:29 UTC proof. No timely-completion claim, new semantic stage or next execution occurs.

## Blast radius

Only P1303's verification, timing and completion receipt are affected. A1021's native evidence and P1307's unexecuted binding remain saved; no historical defect, shared engine behavior or other leaf is inferred from the runtime and closure timing issues.
