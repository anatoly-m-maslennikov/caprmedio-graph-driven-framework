# Summary

Record the first-partition packet completion overrun

## Concern

P1293's original execution and same-leaf recovery exceeded its fifteen-minute estimate. The original clock became available only after the recovered completion was saved.

## Evidences

The original Agent later reported its read-only date result as 2026-10-04 08:39:21 UTC. The independently saved root recovery terminal receipt is 08:59:28 UTC. On that reported original start, total elapsed time is20m07s, exceeding the estimate by5m07s. The separate root recovery08:52:26–08:59:28 remains7m02s; it is not a replacement start.

Earlier saved receipts correctly stated that the original clock was unavailable at their time. This later report supersedes only that uncertainty. The original tool receipt has not been independently reopened; the reported start is not inferred from an Atom's updated_at.

## Blast radius

P1293/A1011 completion timing only. Native evidence and substantive harvest completion remain admitted. The overrun is nonblocking for independent ready work, remains disclosed, and requires later execution estimates to include reading, analysis, persistence and source-binding verification. It grants no new authoring or runtime authority.
