# Summary

Remove the extra final blank line from the harvest Concern

## Concern

The staged new C301 carrier had an extra blank line at EOF. The whitespace gate stopped the scoped Git save; no failed check was treated as a pass.

## Evidences

Actual staged diff check exited2 and named C301 line37, new blank line at EOF. Removed only the extra final blank line with the normal file-edit mechanism and refreshed Updated At; Version1 and meaning remain unchanged. Repeat staged whitespace and strict-carrier checks passed at2026-10-04T07:00:23Z before the actual commit.

## Blast radius

C301 formatting only; source utterances, harvest decisions and native fingerprints unchanged. Resolved mechanical correction; no code, methodology, settings, Journal history or unrelated edits changed.
