# Summary

Retain the first-partition late terminal receipt

## Concern

P1265's complete saved harvest and native/Carrier checks finished within its estimate, but context recovery and repeated terminal checks pushed its final handoff beyond15minutes.

## Evidences

Actual firstclock07:22:43Z. Substantive saved closure07:36:59Z=14m16; later terminalverification07:40:45Z=18m02; finalreceipt07:41:07Z=18m24. All clocks and the overrun remain explicit in A983/P1265. Agent reports all74whole messages/five contexts, individual dispositions, actual nextP1269, parent frontier and native/saved checks. Root stopped further duplicate checks; the current strict saved-state check passes. No reset clock or claim of a within15minute final receipt.

## Blast radius

Scheduling/receipt timing only. Selected source coverage is not withdrawn solely because its later receipt was late. P1269 remains unexecuted until explicitly assigned; no redundant closure Task or stage bypass.
