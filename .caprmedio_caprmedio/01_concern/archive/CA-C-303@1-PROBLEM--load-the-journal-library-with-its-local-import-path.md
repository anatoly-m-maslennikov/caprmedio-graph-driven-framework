# Summary

Load the Journal library with its local import path

## Concern

The checkpoint53 recorded-state diagnostic initially imported the Journal library without its existing sibling-module path. It stopped on ModuleNotFoundError forproject_runtime before any event append.

## Evidences

A read-only check confirmed no epic1117-committed-state-21ebc3d74 event existed after the failed import. The corrected caller supplied the existing201_TOOLS module directory; no library or runtime code was edited. Actual19committed-state events then appended and verified against savedbytes, Git, sealed digests and common prediction/receipt fields. Ownedrecordedstates now209. SharedJournal Git save stayspending dueunrelatedpre-existingedits. These are recovered-state events, not save-Tool completion receipts.

## Blast radius

Only this diagnostic invocation failed. No duplicate append, changed native evidence, unavailable source or required stage bypass.
