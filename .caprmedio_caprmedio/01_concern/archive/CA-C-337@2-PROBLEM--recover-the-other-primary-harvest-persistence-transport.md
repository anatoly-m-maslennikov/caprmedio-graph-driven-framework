# Summary

Recover the other-primary harvest persistence transport.

## Concern

One generated combined patch/binding response exceeded its output transport budget and was truncated before JSON parsing, so no Analysis patch was applied. Keep the actual first clock2026-10-04 11:16:54 UTC; recover complete original evidence before closure. This is a concrete persistence/transport issue, not a historical report defect or a permission to expand work.

## Evidences

The generator response began with the truncation warning and JSON.parse rejected it with `Unexpected token 'W'`. The tool never reached apply_patch. Zero semantic coverage was credited to the incomplete transport. All23 selected original parts and the complete756-character context had already been fully read in a separate untruncated source response. Recovery uses a compact original-record payload, separate carrier construction and one native/saved proof; no source text is shortened or replaced with fragments.

## Blast radius

Only P1321/A1039 persistence and its actual next P1324 binding were affected. Root roll-ups/Git/Journal/authority/Implementation stayed outside this Agent's ownership.

Resolution: complete compact-original persistence recovered the transport failure without truncating any nativepart.
