# Summary

Recover interrupted P1311 harvest and disclose overrun

## Concern

P1311 started2026-10-04 10:58:48UTC, was interrupted before durable output, and recovery exceeded its <=15-minute estimate. Restart cannot reset that first clock. It remains an active nonblocking process-overrun Problem after required output/proof are recovered; timely completion is not claimed.

## Evidences

On recovery P1311 was Active v1 and A1029/C331/P1315/A1033 absent. Root confirmed no transient prep/dispositions survived and no prior full-read claim was established. Preparation encounters included broad .caprmedio_tmp discovery interrupted after slow search, several truncated multi-carrier captures, one guessed A1025 filename miss, and next-source metadata capture whose historical base instructions overflowed the output and obscured an antecedent. Recovery used exact paths, bounded reads and direct frozen-interval retrieval; every selected41/context53 record and the partition4 boundary was fully reopened from original native parts. Relevant next8/context3 were also fully reopened, including whole L9336 separately after overflow; source metadata fields/hash were extracted without treating historical instructions as authority. No content is reconstructed from an unavailable prior worker result.

Saved proof/terminal receipt is appended after persistence. Read/preparation failures resolve only when exact full-native/saved proof passes; original interruption/elapsed overrun remain disclosed. Do not add semantic re-review stages, reset the clock, pad dispositions or treat actual elapsed<=900 as an acceptance test.

C331 remains active/nonblocking for interruption/processoverrun; preparation/read failures are resolved by complete proof. The initial whole-carrier patch-generation capture was truncated before any write and was discarded; a bounded differential patch recovered full persistence without truncating evidence.

Terminal check is recorded here; root sharedcheckpoint/mechanicalcommit remains separate.

## Blast radius

Directly affects P1311 execution/time reporting and its durable A1029 result/next P1315 binding. P1128/P1118 and all third/corpus frontiers remain Active; downstream1119/1130/1155 gates persist. Historical same-twenty evaluator defects and September15 lock reports are harvest evidence, not diagnosed current blockers. Root owns shared checkpoint/mechanical Git; no Journal/authority/code/runtime changes.
