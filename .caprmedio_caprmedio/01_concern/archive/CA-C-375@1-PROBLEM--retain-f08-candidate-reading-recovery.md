# Summary

Retain F08 candidate reading recovery

## Concern

The first combined candidate/current-source display was truncated; omitted text could not count as a complete read. Three shortened source path attempts also returned missing-file diagnostics. These are actual evidence-transport failures, not historical defects or new source/runtime issues.

## Evidences

Recovered the complete saved S005/S006/S008 candidate sections in a smaller display, then all remaining bound sections. Section extraction streams only from each exact bound candidate heading to its next peer/higher heading; no native session, session index or embedded raw-record block was opened. O118 was recovered at 09_operations/RMED_ATOM_REVIEW; O067/O051 were recovered under the complete 00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources path. All compared current Operations were fully read. Start remains 2026-10-04 13:17:37 UTC, without reset.

## Blast radius

Limited to P1403 preparation and elapsed time. Nonblocking after complete bounded recovery: all eighteen assigned candidate clauses and relevant current sources are available. Do not treat a truncated display, missed filename or historical reported success as proof. The separate saved-carrier/completeness/current-revision/local-DAG gate passed / exit 0 at 2026-10-04 13:30:19 UTC, elapsed 12m42s; closure write 2026-10-04 13:31:26 UTC, elapsed 13m49s. No Operation/RMED/code/shared-parent/Git/Journal or runtime change is used as recovery; no source issue or implementation pass is invented.
