# Summary

Recover bounded P1325 control reading.

## Concern

An initial combined live-control/shared-checkpoint read returned superseded checkpoint history beyond the requested current checkpoint, exceeded output capacity and truncated. A later path inventory targeted nonexistent 05_concern before correcting to the actual 01_concern directory. These are actual preparation scope/transport failures, not source evidence corruption.

## Evidences

Actual first clock 2026-10-04 11:51:47 UTC is unchanged and includes recovery. The complete current checkpoint 93 section was subsequently read with a heading-bounded extraction, without another historical dump. Truncated superseded history was not counted as complete live-control reading. All 27 selected source278 native visible parts and four complete manager context visible parts were fully read. Complete encrypted raw contexts are retained whole; no hidden payload is reconstructed. All 24 live authority fingerprints and durable corpus/index fingerprints are unchanged. Saved selected-record binding search found zero prior coverage for these 27 original hashes.

The path miss was corrected to 01_concern without a filesystem mutation. P1325 was interrupted before its combined completion proof and is now Canceled by Operator instruction; no completion proof or terminal execution duration is claimed. No source scope, authority or historical command was changed. A1043's 27 records are not admitted completed evidence.

Administrative closure retained the initial partial report and the original 11:51:47 clock. An initial content-patch generator unnecessarily included complete existing native bindings in its diff and exceeded output capacity; it was rejected before apply_patch or any mutation. The corrected bounded patch changes only status/control headings and administrative disposition prose, preserving all saved JSON blocks and all Done carrier bytes. C344 records this actual administrative transport recovery as directly affecting P1118 closure. No native session was opened. Administrative closure began with clock 2026-10-04 12:19:38 UTC; status/content disposition clock is 12:23:32 UTC, separate from interrupted execution.

The first administrative placement check incorrectly assumed five matching directories total, overlooking three already-Done composite bundles. The corrected distinction is five canceled matching bundles and three preserved Done bundles; all 114 Done carriers remain byte-identical. This was a diagnostic assumption failure, not a carrier or source failure. A final bookkeeping patch was rejected atomically for duplicate P1118 operations before any edit; the corrected patch uses one update per file. Administrative closure receipt 2026-10-04 12:29:15 UTC confirms all 16 formerly Active harvest Plans are Canceled, P1118 detached, outgoing canceled readiness edges removed and A1043's 27 interrupted records excluded. No further execution or source reading follows; the original interrupted completion gate remains unperformed.

## Blast radius

Preparation transport/scope, interruption and the administrative stop disposition only. Resolved administratively because the Operator canceled further harvest execution; this is not a passing P1325 completion gate. A1043 remains partial, recoverable and explicitly excluded from all completed counts. Original 11:51:47 execution clock is retained; interruption/terminal execution time remains unavailable and is not reconstructed. The current administrative closure reads no native sessions, performs no missing harvest proof and creates no further harvest work.
