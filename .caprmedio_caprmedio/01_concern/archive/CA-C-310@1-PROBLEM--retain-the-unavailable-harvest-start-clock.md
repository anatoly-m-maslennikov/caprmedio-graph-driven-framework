# Summary

Retain the unavailable harvest start clock

## Concern

P1269's initial closure lacked an actual retained first/terminal clock, and its nextP1290 lacked mandatory updated_at.

## Evidences

The same Agent corrected P1290's timestamp and retained terminal12:02:51+0400 in A987/P1269/parent1126, but reported firstclock unavailable from its receipts. No firstclock or exactelapsed is invented. A within15minute claim therefore remains unproved; the Agent's overrun wording is its report, not an independently measured interval. Coordination wait and closure correction are explicit. Whole26native-record/fivecontext harvest remains saved; registered fields/headers/singleEOFnewline checked. Root's fullstrict verification follows this correction.

## Blast radius

Historical timing proof and closure-field omissions only. No new coverage or stage bypass. Disposition is retain the unavailable timing evidence explicitly, not repeatedly attempt to recreate an unknowable clock or withdraw complete source-reading solely because timing is missing. Next tasks must obtain an actual firstclock before work.
