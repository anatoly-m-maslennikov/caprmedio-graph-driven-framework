# Summary

Normalize the compared F14 Operation carriers

## Concern

Eight current authoritative Operation carriers fully read for F14 comparison do not carry all required current properties. This is a narrow source-carrier Problem; it does not assert a semantic failure of the covered behavior or authorize broader cleanup.

## Evidences

The exact source directory and filenames/revisions are retained in A1077. O102 v2, O100 v3, O090 v4, O101 v2, O098 v4, O018 v6 and O020 v5 use `## Claim` rather than registered `## Operation` and have no `## Details`. Current D479 v6 requires exactly one `# Summary`, `## Operation`, then `## Details` for Operations.

O118 v1 has its registered body headings but lacks the top-level `claim_target_scope_unit` string required by current D482 v7. The carried current scope is CORE_META_MODEL; the missing target must be resolved and carried under current authority, not silently inferred from location during review. These facts were observed in full current sources, not copied historical reports or projections. The saved proof at2026-10-04 13:10:19UTC confirmed these eight exact current-source issues and this typed Concern's strict registered carrier.

## Blast radius

Only the eight compared F14 sources are bound to this Problem. Authoring/independent review must perform any authorized carrier normalization, preserving their existing semantic behavior and separate learning, accounting, calibration and no-automatic-recheck boundaries. No O/RMED/code/parent/Git/Journal change occurred here. P1359's bounded semantic reconciliation can complete with the issue explicitly retained; this Concern remains active until the separately owned source repairs and registered-carrier verification are complete. It is not a global source audit or cleanup request.
