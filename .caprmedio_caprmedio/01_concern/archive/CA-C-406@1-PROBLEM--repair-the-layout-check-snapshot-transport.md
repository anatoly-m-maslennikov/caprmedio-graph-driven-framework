# Summary

Repair the layout check snapshot transport

## Concern

the layout preservation check stopped because its inline JSON snapshot was decoded with interpreted newlines, before validating the edited sources.

## Evidences

the assigned worker corrected the diagnostic encoding and reran the same bounded check. actual PASS at 2026-10-04 15:08:54 UTC proved all four saved sources equal the permitted full-before-text transformation, with unchanged meaningful text, Versions, fields and explicit targets. no source rework followed the diagnostic repair.

## Blast radius

the disposable verification transport only; independent source review and runtime remain separate.
