# Summary

Repair the source-authoring preflight binding

## Concern

the preparation worker reported that a malformed patch was rejected before changing the preflight Carrier. the executable bindings require the corrected saved preflight before source authoring begins.

## Evidences

the worker reported table rows without patch prefixes and corrected an earlier O019 Carrier locator to the actual authoritative source. the corrected save passed its actual gate at 2026-10-04 15:00:12 UTC: fifteen strict unique Plan Carriers, five semantic leaves, nine layout leaves, thirty-five unique existing targets, exact input and target paths/current source Revisions, and acyclic preflight-to-leaf-to-review gates. no source Operation or runtime was changed by the failed save or preparation.

## Blast radius

the source-authoring preflight and its dispatch gate only. the binding failure is resolved from the actual saved-gate result; independent source review and implementation remain separate obligations.
