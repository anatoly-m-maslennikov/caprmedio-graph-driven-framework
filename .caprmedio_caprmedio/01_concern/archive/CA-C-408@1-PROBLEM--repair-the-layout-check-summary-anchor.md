# Summary

Repair the layout check summary anchor

## Concern

the layout preservation probe stopped on its Summary-reading anchor before a completed source check.

## Evidences

the same corrected check passed with exit zero at 2026-10-04 15:11:17 UTC: four reopened sources, exact permitted raw differences, duplicate-safe YAML, unchanged Summary, Versions, other fields and meaningful body/table order, and required headings, targets and end-of-file. P1427 was physically Done at 15:12:44 UTC. the original stopped probe supplies no passing result or source-content mismatch.

## Blast radius

the disposable preservation diagnostic and this leaf completion gate only; do not alter source meaning to satisfy an incorrect probe.
