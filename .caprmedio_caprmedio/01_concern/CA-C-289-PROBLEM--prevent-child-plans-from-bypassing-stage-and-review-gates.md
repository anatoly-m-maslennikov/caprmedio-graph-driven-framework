# Summary

Prevent child Plans from bypassing stage and review gates

## Concern

The initial CA-P-1117 decomposition linked stage completion to subsequent composite Plans but omitted direct blockers for their first executable children; it also lacked a separate pre-build independent Docker RMED review gate. Because decomposition does not imply BLOCKS, a child or build could otherwise be treated as ready prematurely.

## Evidences

CA-R-1580 version 4 states that navigation, shared Hub and decomposition do not establish BLOCKS. The first authored decomposition had CA-P-1118 BLOCKS CA-P-1119 but no CA-P-1118 BLOCKS CA-P-1130, with corresponding omissions at later stage boundaries. CA-P-1142 initially blocked CA-P-1143 directly without a separate independent review Plan.

### Resolution

Added explicit stage-to-first-child BLOCKS edges, including both PROGRAMMATIC and PROMPTS specification gates for implementation. Added CA-P-1149 as an independent Docker RMED review and changed the build path to CA-P-1142 -> CA-P-1149 -> CA-P-1143. Validate the final authored graph for cycles and prerequisite reachability before the governed save. This Concern retains the issue and repair provenance; it is not an external-runtime failure or a claim that any Epic work has executed.

## Blast radius

Project-level Epic CA-P-1117 spans methodology, PROGRAMMATIC, PROMPTS, MCP and Docker delivery. Premature execution could implement stale or unreviewed authority. The narrowest common owning Scope Unit is the Project; no other active Plan was modified.
