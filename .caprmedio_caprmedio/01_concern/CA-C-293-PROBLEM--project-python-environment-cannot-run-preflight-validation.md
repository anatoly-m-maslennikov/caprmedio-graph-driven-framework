# Summary

Project Python environment cannot run preflight validation

## Concern

The current Project Python environment cannot execute the intended PyYAML-based structural verification for CA-P-1150. This is an actual runtime verification failure, not missing app metadata or a failed harvest. Do not represent a narrower fallback as a full YAML/parser validation.

## Evidences

- `uv run --locked python` reported: `Project virtual environment directory .../.venv cannot be used because it is not a valid Python environment (no Python executable was found)` and a project environment-lock warning.
- Available system `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` reported `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` when checked for the parser.
- A single isolated `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml` attempt failed with cache rename `Operation not permitted (os error 1)` under `.caprmedio_tmp/cache/uv`. No additional installation, permission retry or environment repair was performed.
- App metadata listing independently succeeded: 20 recent records plus 6 pinned records, no unavailable host/source reported. This Problem does not invalidate those source IDs.
- At 2026-10-04 07:01:57 +0400, the existing healthy Docker worker independently parsed all 60 current Epic Plan carriers with PyYAML 6.0.3 and duplicate-key rejection. Required fields/headings, unique Atom IDs and the combined completion DAG passed. The check read existing Project carriers; it did not repair the local environment or change dependencies.
- CA-P-1176 moved the completed metadata Plan file and every matching bundle file into the declared Done location with apply_patch. Removing the two obsolete empty directories at the old CA-P-1125 location reported `Operation not permitted`; they contain no remaining carrier files. No permission retry or filesystem repair was attempted. This observed filesystem limitation is retained alongside the earlier cache-rename permission failure; it does not invalidate saved metadata, alter descendant Status, or claim that the empty directories were removed.

## Blast radius

The failure affects the local Project Python environment and may affect future host-side checks. No implementation code, dependency declarations, environment or permissions were changed. Current disposition: nonblocking for metadata preparation; system Python checks cover metadata and structural results, and the existing Docker runtime supplied the actual parser-backed Plan validation above. This is not a general semantic evaluation or local environment repair. Keep this Concern Active for later separately authorized environment repair; it is not an added prerequisite to bounded metadata discovery. The main Agent owns Git saves; no save-Tool receipt is fabricated here.
