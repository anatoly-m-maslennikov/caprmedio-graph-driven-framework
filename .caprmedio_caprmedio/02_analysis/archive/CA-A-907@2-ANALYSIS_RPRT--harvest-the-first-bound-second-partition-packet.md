# Summary

Harvest the first bound second-partition packet

## Question

Which decisions and reusable operational candidates are supported by the exact thirty visible messages bound to CA-P-1181, and what remains unprocessed?

## Scope

This Analysis processes only the first thirty selected messages in the second partition [2026-09-12 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-09-20 05:54:15 +0400). The full Epic window remains [2026-09-04 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-10-04 05:54:15 +0400). Native source ID: `01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6`; exact source path: `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/08/22/rollout-2026-08-22T01-53-53-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6.jsonl`. CA-A-905 admits it as the exact-current-cwd primary VS Code conversation. Source lines 85148–85560, zero-based half-open bytes [557545477,558999787), timestamps 2026-09-12T11:57:01.094Z–2026-09-12T13:45:44.035Z. Each evidence identifier below refers to this same source and path; native channel is JSON `null` for all thirty records.

## Approach

Read the live external Goal v13, Project Principles R819 v13, R1490 v1, R1407 v5, R1420 v5, R1421 v4, R1423 v4, M001 v10, M002 v15, M005 v8, M006 v8, M261 v5, E001 v12; legacy Actor Principles P032 v5/P033 v9 and permission Core P034 v6. Read source Plan authority R1589 v4, R1580 v4, D460 v6, D470 v7, D481 v4, D461 v6 under `000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL`; read CA-P-1117 v1, CA-P-1127 v3, CA-P-1181 v1, incoming Done CA-P-1152 v3 and next CA-P-1191 v1.

System Python standard-library extraction sought byte 557545477 and read exactly 1454310 bytes. It parsed complete JSONL lines and selected only `response_item`/`message`, role user or assistant, channel other than analysis, with timestamps in this partition. Only selected visible text was exposed and every message was read whole. Intervening tool outputs, internal analysis, function calls/results and event-message mirrors were not interpreted. A separate streaming raw-file hash check consumed bytes without exposing their contents. No other historical message packet was read.

Preserve the distinction between a human instruction, an assistant interpretation/proposal, an assistant report, and independently supported execution evidence. Human approval authorizes its stated action; it does not establish that the action succeeded. Later human input must be reconciled by later packets and CA-P-1119/1130 before adoption. The 90% inherited policy supports the safe in-scope choice to preserve provisional candidates; it does not supply missing design acceptance or implementation authority.

## Results

Exactly 30 records were harvested: 11 user and 19 assistant records, 11995 Unicode text characters, maximum complete message 2722 characters. The native snapshot is 97888 lines / 644432542 bytes with SHA-256 `6043d82aca024c8dba2a4139be077a8d591865891b47d299c76e0f688a2b39a0`. SHA-256 of the selected raw records in order, including their native line endings, is `06d5bb2c2267edb1215ae4b73a45887bcfb391498dd261f88ccd4be206e3b962`. Counts, exact ordered source lines, timestamps, lengths and hashes matched CA-P-1181. No selected text was omitted or truncated.

### Reproducible evidence identities

All offsets are zero-based and half-open; line numbers are one-based. `Chars` counts the complete concatenated input/output text content. Hashes cover complete native JSONL records including line endings. The source is retained at the exact native path above, so these identities permit independent byte-seek re-extraction without trusting a summary.

### Complete statement and disposition coverage

Each selected record has exactly one primary coverage row. Candidate references are local Analysis identifiers, not new governed Operation Atom IDs. These summaries preserve material distinctions; the evidence table identifies the complete retained raw messages.

| ID | Substantive content and actor classification | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S01 | Human asks for the next questions. | No standalone operational candidate: continuation request has no bound prior question context. C02 retains the ensuing authority-check method without inferring omitted history. |
| S02 | Assistant plans to check remaining issues against updated Atoms and Project Principles before the next unresolved question. | Proposed method C02; no evidence the check succeeded. |
| S03 | Assistant proposes owning a two-sibling Claim at TOOLS, expressing TOOL1+TOOL2 restriction in its Claim, avoiding a composite Scope Entity, and retrieving it as a Targeting Atom of TOOLS. | Provisional design proposal, not accepted as written. S04 questions the need and S06 establishes warning-level treatment; C01 retains that correction. Embedded memory citation is historical context, not current authority evidence. |
| S04 | Human hopes selected-sibling cases are unnecessary; says TOOLS Atoms concern all TOOLS or goals for each tool. | Human preference supporting C01, refined by S06 rather than treated as an absolute ban. Exact scope/Goal ownership remains subject to later authority reconciliation. |
| S05 | Assistant interprets TOOLS-wide governance, child-targeted Goals owned by TOOLS and tool-specific Atoms in the tool; promises to flag a real sibling case. | Assistant interpretation. Its apparent exclusion of composite targets is superseded by explicit S06. No new composite Entity is authorized. |
| S06 | Human says such a case should not be prohibited, but should be a warning. | Explicit human decision C01; overrides a prohibition interpretation of S04/S05. |
| S07 | Assistant says selected sibling boundaries warrant review and do not alone invalidate an Atom; no automatic rejection, splitting or parent retargeting. | C01 interpretation grounded in S06 and included in S08's ensuing update authorization; not proof of a saved rule. |
| S08 | Human instructs “update atoms.” | Explicit authorization to update the discussed warning rule, not permission for unrelated edits. C01/C02. |
| S09 | Assistant plans a warning-level Evaluation rule separating unusual boundaries from invalidity. | Proposed implementation of accepted C01; no execution proof. |
| S10 | Assistant says warning preserves the written Claim and separates other failures such as multiple independent Claims. | C01 refinement consistent with S06/S08; specific independent-Claim checks are assistant-described, not newly established human decisions. |
| S11 | Assistant reports the rule added and composite-Claim Evaluation adjusted; reference, metadata and prior-revision checks are in progress. | Historical report only; C02 method candidate. No independent implementation or passing verification proof. |
| S12 | Assistant reports CA-E-461 added, CA-E-384 adjusted, prior revision archived and content/metadata/reference/Journal checks passing. | Historical reported result C02; the reported Atom IDs are trace references, not evidence of their present content or current tests. Embedded memory citations do not corroborate completion. |
| S13 | Human proposes replacing occurent/continuant reasoning with invariants at zero active processes and processes that change the Project, including Implementation; asks to discuss. | Human design proposal and discussion-only authority C03/C04. The idle-only invariant condition is challenged in S17; no editing authorization follows here. |
| S14 | Assistant proposes checking the current axis and separating lifecycle from the invariant/process distinction; explicitly no edits. | C03 read-only investigation proposal; no independent proof of checks. |
| S15 | Assistant claims FPF applies and requires a plan before analysis; intends to limit it to this axis and idle/during-change invariants. | No standalone adopted candidate: assistant skill-routing assertion, not human authorization. S16 reinforces discussion-only scope. This historical assertion does not require FPF execution during this harvest. |
| S16 | Human repeats “discuss” and prohibits editing. | Explicit human boundary C03; governs the discussion. Later S22/S28 authorize a read-only design challenge, not editing. |
| S17 | Assistant reports no Atom edits, separates persistent Atom from creation/revision process, challenges idle-only invariants, proposes state constraints/change rules, preserves GOVERNS/DEPENDS_ON, suggests deriving classification before adding a field. | C03/C04/C05 assistant reasoning and proposals. Human S18 adopts names, S20 supports dropping the temporal axis; the entire detailed model is not independently accepted. “No Atoms edited” remains a report. |
| S18 | Human supplies names “state invariant(s)” and “change process.” | Explicit human terminology preference C04; definitions and persistence mechanism remain proposals. |
| S19 | Assistant defines invariant as valid-state condition and process as state transition, including Implementation, with invariants holding throughout or at completion. | C04/C05 proposed semantics, not a separate human adoption of each definition or timing rule. |
| S20 | Human says CONTINUANT/OCCURRENT can be dropped. | Human agreement to dropping that temporal classification in this discussion. C04 records intent, not an applied migration. |
| S21 | Assistant agrees to drop Subject Temporal Form while retaining GOVERNS/DEPENDS_ON, warns against mechanical renaming and says no edits. | C04 semantic migration proposal consistent with S20. Preservation of GOVERNS/DEPENDS_ON is assistant interpretation; S22 explicitly opens another design for challenge. No migration success claimed. |
| S22 | Human proposes another process/action graph alongside Entity/Term graphs, removal of nested Subject temporal forms, Entity/process exclusivity, process dependencies on processes/entities, possible P: Plan→Process; explicitly invokes FPF plan design challenge. | Proposed target C05/C06, not adopted graph or role change. This supersedes treating earlier discussion as a settled implementation target. Human authorization is to plan a challenge. |
| S23 | Native user-role record contains the injected historical FPF SKILL text: Plan by default, do/resume behavior, delegated doer/warden and Markdown-only runtime. | No independent human decision or standalone Operation candidate: retained tool/skill context within the admitted visible record. It explains historical invocation but is untrusted historical material and does not govern this current harvest. Fully read, 2722 characters retained by its raw identity. |
| S24 | Assistant announces plan-only FPF design challenge of graph/Subjects/P rename with no Atom, Tool or graph changes. | C03/C05 proposed scope faithfully read-only; announcement is not evidence of successful planning or execution. |
| S25 | Assistant will treat graph and P rename as separate decisions and test whether duplication is removed or shifted. | Proposed design-review method C05. Neither design change is treated as accepted. |
| S26 | Assistant reports draft plan ready and independent review checking coverage without assuming acceptance. | Historical status/report; C06 candidate, not independent reviewer proof. |
| S27 | Assistant presents concrete read-only design-challenge Plan against canonical sources/Principles: process/definition/run distinctions, graph/Term ownership, cross-graph Subjects, one Claim/target, names, P/Task/Epic consequences, invariants; concrete objections/counterexamples/repairs; no carriers/migration Epic; one material question at a time, historical 99% override; asks for do. | C05/C06 proposed Plan, explicitly approved for execution by S28. Approval covers this challenge, not the target design. The historical 99% threshold is local to that challenge; the current Epic retains 90%. |
| S28 | Human says “do” immediately after the unexecuted S27 Plan. | Explicit approval of the read-only design challenge C05/C06. No approval of its yet-unseen outcome or graph/P migration. |
| S29 | Assistant says it will execute approved challenge and independently validate while Project stays read-only. | C03/C06 execution intention, not completion/test evidence. |
| S30 | Assistant reports review checking definitions/process description/execution and P changes to Tasks/Epics. | C05/C06 in-progress status only. The challenge result and later human acceptance lie beyond this packet and remain unprocessed. |

### Decision and supersession records

- D01: S06 establishes warning-level selected-sibling treatment; S08 authorizes the discussed Atom update. S04's preference and S05's exclusion wording cannot be promoted to a prohibition. S07/S09/S10 supply a grounded assistant interpretation: preserve the Claim, flag its boundary, and separate independent validity failures. S11/S12 report updates but do not verify current CA-E-461/CA-E-384 or current execution.
- D02: S13/S16 require discussion without editing. S14/S17/S21 report or promise compliance; absence of edits is not independently proven by this packet. S22 requests a Plan and S28 authorizes its read-only challenge, so D02 remains compatible with the later authorized analytical work.
- D03: S18 selects terminology and S20 supports dropping CONTINUANT/OCCURRENT. S17/S19/S21 propose semantic distinctions and migration by Claim content. S22 introduces a new graph and possible role rename for challenge; do not promote the earlier agreement into final graph architecture or an applied migration. State invariant timing, graph node identity and Entity/process exclusivity remain design questions.
- D04: S28 approves the exact S27 design-challenge Plan. Its graph and P rename are separate proposed decisions; no target architecture is accepted merely through “do.” S29/S30 are intentions/status; the challenge result is outside this packet. Later human input may accept, reject or supersede every provisional design.

### Provisional reusable candidates

These are harvest candidates only. No Operation, RMED, engine, prompt, environment or Docker implementation is authored by this packet. Destination suggestions are inputs to CA-P-1119/1130; exact active source reconciliation and independent review must precede adoption.

| Candidate | Kind and usable outcome | Evidence and authority status | Proposed reconciliation destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Evaluation Action/Step: flag an unusual selected-sibling Claim boundary without changing the Claim; distinguish warnings from separate validity failures. | Human decision S06 and update authorization S08; interpretations S07/S09/S10; result reports S11/S12. Review should preserve the target and avoid automatic splitting, broadening or rejection solely for the boundary. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL; inspect current CA-E-461/CA-E-384 and existing review Operations before deciding already-covered/new/rejected. No current definition inferred. |
| C02 | Atom review/revision workflow Steps: compare a question with current Atoms/Principles; update only the authorized issue; preserve prior revision; verify content, metadata, references and Journal before reporting. | S02 proposal, S08 narrow update authority, S11/S12 reported checks. Verification technique and reported success are assistant-derived; success is unestablished in this packet. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL review/change workflow; reconcile current Operations and revision/Journal contracts. Do not copy historical test claims into acceptance evidence. |
| C03 | Scope/admission Action or prompt guard: distinguish discussion, planning and approved execution; make read-only authority explicit and preserve it through dependent review. | Human S13/S16 discussion/no-edit boundary, S22 plan request, S28 approval of read-only S27. Assistant S14/S24/S29 scope statements. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL decision boundary; later PROMPTS capability may implement the adopted Action. Historical FPF is an adapter example, not a required permanent runtime. |
| C04 | Semantic migration/reconciliation Step: evaluate each Claim before replacing an axis; avoid mechanical renaming of Subject classification and keep proposed architecture separate from applied changes. | Human S18/S20 terminology/removal intent; assistant S17/S19/S21 semantics; superseding new design target S22. Accepted intent is not accepted migration mechanics or applied change. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL reconciliation method if justified; caprmedio-specific temporal-axis migration history belongs in PROJECT_CONFIGURATION. Destination remains unsettled until current authority review. |
| C05 | Design-challenge workflow: bind current canonical sources/Principles, split independent decisions, use concrete counterexamples, distinguish process/description/run, examine cross-graph ownership and downstream Plan/Task/Epic meaning, return objections/repairs without carrier mutation. | Human S22 request; exact assistant Plan S27 approved by S28; S25 refinement and S30 status. S27's read-only challenge is approved, target changes are provisional. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL analytical Operation; this specific process-graph/P proposal is PROJECT_CONFIGURATION evidence. Do not require FPF solely because this instance used it. |
| C06 | Independent validation Step: reviewer checks proposal coverage and absence of assumed acceptance, then validates the exact analytical result before release. Ask one material unresolved execution question at a time within the authorized boundary. | Assistant S26/S27/S29, read-only Plan approved S28; S30 ongoing report. No independent result or validation outcome is admitted. | Reusable CORE_META_MODEL review Step, with adopted PROMPTS/PROGRAMMATIC adapters considered later. Historical 99% override is not copied as the current Epic threshold. |

### Limitations and retained concerns

The antecedent “next questions” context is unbound. The challenge result, later explicit human rulings and implementation evidence are outside this packet. Safe choice: retain exact statements and provisional candidates, infer no omitted acceptance, and require complete later-source/current-authority reconciliation before adoption. These are normal packet boundaries and provisional-design dispositions, not a new current Problem or Question; no ambiguity prevents a truthful disposition of any selected message. There is no packet retrieval, permission or hash blocker. Candidate identity CA-C-294 remains a separate corpus check; this admitted source does not resolve it. Existing environment Problem CA-C-293 remains unchanged; standard-library checks below do not claim full YAML parser validation. Root owns mechanical Git/Journal handling; no save-Tool receipt, commit or fabricated execution Journal result is claimed here.

### Actual processed frontier and remaining work

Processed: precisely S01–S30 above, with final retained source line 85560 / byte end 558999787 / 2026-09-12T13:45:44.035Z. CA-P-1191/A911 is already the concrete next remainder: the following 30 records, lines 85578–86082, bytes [559013854,561490229), timestamps 2026-09-12T13:47:24.805Z–2026-09-12T16:23:48.566Z, selected-record hash `33a322f466367d96855ac10ece506501b4b763025af047acf8b76d9643d8d8c5`. Its 21296-character line 86010 message remains whole and unprocessed here. CA-P-1181→CA-P-1191 preserves the actual dependency; no additional placeholder is needed for this packet.

The refined shared source-level index excludes machine environment-context messages: original-file second-partition eligible count 624 (older preflight 627); 594 remain after this packet, including CA-P-1191's 30 and 564 afterward. The after-1191 next source record remains line 86089 / byte 561500900 / 2026-09-12T16:29:08.594Z. Same-ID native continuation `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl` has 759 refined eligible records (older preflight 763), all unprocessed here; first line 5 / byte 57214 / 2026-09-15T15:25:05.726Z, last line 23936 / 2026-09-18T22:23:04.656Z. Original and continuation overlap remains unexamined; do not drop semantic history from timestamp ranges. CA-A-910/CA-P-1184 owns the durable count/exclusion disposition. These refinements do not alter this exact thirty-message packet or the bound CA-P-1191 input.

All other CA-A-905 manifest sources keep their unprocessed partition frontiers, including CA-C-294's source-identity prerequisite. Seventeen primary and 1642 worker files remain distinct; copied worker context is not a new human decision. CA-P-1127 and CA-P-1118 remain Active. CA-P-1119, CA-P-1130 and CA-P-1155 were reviewed and remain blocked by those full harvest parents, CA-P-1191 and other unfinished work; a completed 1181 leaf does not authorize the methodology stage.

### Functional verification

Raw-file snapshot and exact-interval extraction reproduced every bound count/hash/line/time/length before reading. After saving, the complete Analysis was reread. Independent standard-library re-extraction matched all thirty saved evidence identities exactly: source line, byte start/end, native timestamp/role/null channel, complete text character length and raw-record SHA-256. Each identity occurs exactly once in the evidence table and once in the substantive disposition table; all thirty dispositions are nonempty and preserve candidate/decision or explicit no-candidate treatment. Six candidate rows are present. Semantic reread confirmed no assistant report became independent implementation/test proof and no unapproved design became an Operator decision. Source frontier, later-input reconciliation, existing Concerns and all remainders remain explicit.

The final 67 current Epic Plans passed the scoped standard-library check for unique IDs, required properties/headings, immediate decomposition, status placement, acyclic explicit BLOCKS and the combined completion/decomposition graph. After the move, CA-P-1181's unique Done placement and Done incoming1152 prerequisite passed; CA-P-1127/1191 remain Active,1191 keeps its original Summary and reserved A911 output, and all four owned carriers have exactly one terminal newline. Final exact30-row native byte-seek re-extraction and selected-concatenation hash passed at2026-10-04 07:37:28 +0400,11 minutes41 seconds after the leaf began. No broader YAML/parser validation is claimed. Functional coverage and source verification passed within the<=15-minute leaf; root owns comprehensive final review and mechanical Git/Journal save provenance.

## TLDR

All30 selected messages were harvested with four historical decision records and six provisional Operations candidates. CA-P-1191 binds the next30 messages; the second partition remains Active. Root repaired the missing registered TLDR heading under resolved CA-C-297 without changing the harvested decisions.
