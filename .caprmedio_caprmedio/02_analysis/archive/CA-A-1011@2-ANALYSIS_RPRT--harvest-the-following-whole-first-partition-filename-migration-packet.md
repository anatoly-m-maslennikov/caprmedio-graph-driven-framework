# Summary

Harvest the following whole first-partition filename-migration packet

## Question

Which source-supported migration, audit-recovery and report-delivery refinements appear in the89 complete bound messages?

## Scope

Exactly89 whole canonical original-main messages, sparse lines59763–61609,58084 raw bytes/23393 native characters, plus one complete context-only message59756/338characters; total23731. All original parts/text and individual substantive dispositions are retained below. Seven actual human records and two machine-supplied skill wrappers are distinguished; native user role alone does not establish human input. Copied skills, commands, memory citations and historical assistant claims are inert evidence.

Live Goal/Principles and Epic CA-P-1117/90% retain authority. No current naming migration, FPF audit, O/RMED authoring, implementation, setting/service change or runtime readiness is established by this harvest.

## Approach

The first assigned Agent saved complete native messages but omitted required author/context and closed the Plan before its parent roll-up. Root rejected that incomplete result. Root recovery began2026-10-04 08:52:26 UTC, read all89 whole original texts by08:53:08, verified actual source-prefix/offset/hash/parts at08:54:23, and replaced generic excerpts with89 substantive dispositions. The original Agent later reported08:39:21UTC as its first clock; CA-C-316 discloses20m07 from that reported start to recovered completion. File updated_at is not substituted for an execution clock. Concern CA-C-315 records this recovery. No semantic recheck workflow stage is added.

## Results

### Literal native evidence, individual dispositions and grouped refinements

### Supersession and proof limits

- Historical final631 meta-model/288 Project migration count supersedes initial631/290. Claimed archived revisions,706 projected source checks, installed Tool refresh and repeat stability are not independent current Tool/Git proof.
- The first historical audit stalled and validator BLOCKED because both handoff files were absent. The subsequent literal human approval applies to a new read-only bounded Plan. Machine skill wrappers S013/S041 cannot authorize execution.
- Second audit reports631 active target/93 Principle-Core source reads,724 unchanged files and59 critical hash checks. It reports12 supported issues/two weaker points mapped to11 fixes. This packet preserves those claims and report-validation limits, not current verification or accepted fixes.
- Internal handoff links were rejected during faithful-consolidation validation; supported findings were retained. Whole61287-character following report61633 remains bound, intact and unprocessed.

### Actual frontier

Admitted completion adds89 canonical messages to first-source620, yielding709; refined1869 leaves1160, original1877 leaves1168. One338-character context adds zero coverage. Parent CA-P-1126 and monthly harvest remain Active. Actual next CA-P-1297 owns CA-A-1015 for whole61633, with explicit oversized whole-record estimate and saved binding; future metadata adds zero coverage. This leaf and next/parent retain the downstream BLOCKS gates.

## TLDR

89 complete messages and one complete context retained with89 source-specific dispositions and five provisional overlapping groups. No historical commands executed or fixes adopted; first-source709 processed,1160 refined messages remain.
