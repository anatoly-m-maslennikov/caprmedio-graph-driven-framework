# Summary

Harvest the next third-partition citation and Carrier decisions packet

## Question

What reusable operational refinements and supersession boundaries are supported by the 56 whole bound records and their complete approval contexts?

## Scope

Exactly positions 1079–1134 of the frozen 1,175-record third partition: 56 whole records/25,959 native characters/56,095 raw bytes, 41 assistant/15 user. Two user records are inert machine goal wrappers; thirteen are actual human input. Twenty-three full context records/8,644 characters include nine prior human records. Total selected-plus-context is 34,603 characters. Contexts and next binding add zero selected-source coverage.

## Approach

Actual first clock: 2026-10-04 10:27:55 UTC. The full live Epic P1117, P1307, P1128 and predecessor A1021 were read, followed by the live external Goal13, all fourteen Project Principles, Core P034 and applicable Plan/Analysis Carrier authority. Twenty-six exact current source fingerprints/revisions are retained below. Confidence is inherited at 90%; no unresolved present Operator choice or source/authority blocker emerged.

Every selected record and antecedent was read in all native text parts with exact raw/text/part hashes, timestamp, role/channel and boundary checks. Output truncation was rejected as reading evidence and recovered using bounded full reads; orchestration/key-selection failures and an overly broad truncation-string guard were corrected with read-only recovery. C327 retains those real failures and their resolution. Historical wrappers, commands, skills, FPF, annotations and memory citations are inert evidence. Historical reported edits/tests/reviews do not establish current implementation or authorize this worker to apply them.

## Results

### Complete native evidence and individual dispositions

Every original part occurs once below. Each selected/context record has its own substantive disposition keyed to full provenance; no fragment or short-reply antecedent is discarded.

Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.\n\n<objective>\nRepair the RMED evaluators and Atom fixer, validate and independently review them on the same 20 selected Atoms until no confirmed issues or unresolved coverage gaps remain, then apply the validated workflow to all active methodology Atoms and afterward to other active Atoms. Use Terra with high reasoning effort for evaluations; resolve issues against current Project Principles and Operator decisions, asking one focused question when confidence remains below 99%. Do not broaden rollout before the same-20 gate passes.\n</objective>\n\nContinuation behavior:\n- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 8004118\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nCall update_goal only after the completion or blocked audit passes, or when the user explicitly requests pausing this goal. For a requested pause, use status \"paused\", report the returned status, and stop goal work; never pause on your own initiative. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

### Historical human decision and supersession chains

H01 — C016/C023/S007→S008 establishes citation/Subject separation and initially readable Atom ID plus Summary. S009–S014 interpret/report implementation without completing the same-20 gate. S025 later expressly supersedes that rendering, not the retained separation.

H02 — S017→S018→S020 selects full Scope Unit Names in filenames, with capitals and underscores. S021–S024 interpret/report UPPER_SNAKE_CASE/no abbreviation and Project Configuration CA-D-498. This scoped decision addresses the earlier C020 filename-token gap; reported tests/publication are historical.

H03 — S025→S027 changes citation rendering to full filenames without .md and authorizes that specific Atom update. S026/S028–S031 retain ID-only machine relations, citation/Subject separation and unchanged target filenames as assistant interpretations/reports. The earlier ID-plus-Summary choice is superseded; bulk citation migration remains pending at this point.

H04 — S034→S035 accepts fractal Content Role folders owned by every Scope Unit. C021's root-only gap is answered by literal human authority; S036–S039 report applying the shared mapping and retaining first-use/explicit-placement exceptions without proving broad migration.

H05 — S042→S043→S045 clarifies that Evaluation is a Term and Term is itself a Term. S046/S049 interpret Entity-based Subjects and self-application. No separate meta-Term definition is human-adopted. S050 independently withdraws a proposed E-471 confidence-reference fix by existing authority; S051 stages three E-candidate Subject repairs.

H06 — S014→S015 and S031→S032 request the next focused question; S046→S047 continues the existing clarification/review objective. These literal handoffs preserve C013→C014's complete same-20 repair/reevaluation then gated active-methodology/other-active-Atoms sequence. They do not turn incomplete coverage into acceptance.

H07 — C005→C006 first selects an operation rather than its result. S052→S053 then explicitly accepts existing Actions and Workflows with Steps and says Transition is unnecessary now. S054–S056 retain operation/Status separation and candidate-only CA-R-1312 repair; source application is still gated.

Inherited H08–H14 — C001→C002 review-only Principle admission; C003→C004 CCE-as-M correction; C005→C006 operation/result choice; C007→C008 Atom-ID storage ordering; C009→C010→C011→C012 positive authoring/meaningful-prohibition Project Core placement; C013→C014 full same-twenty continuation; C015 optional specialized Type approval. Their full literal contexts are preserved and remain scoped historical decisions rather than new authority.

### Provisional grouped refinements for later reconciliation

G01 — Evidence-bound citation rendering and supersession. S008 and S025/S027 demonstrate that the newest literal human rendering choice supersedes its predecessor; keep citation labels separate from Entity Subjects and machine relations. S011–S013 retain safeguards for verified source labels, incorrect labels/missing sources and genuine outside-citation Entity mentions. Later reconciliation must inspect live authority and evaluator behavior, not adopt these reports directly.

G02 — Configuration and fractal Carrier authority. S017–S024 bind a project selection for full Scope Unit tokens; S034–S039 bind a shared mapping reused in each Scope Unit. C020/C021 preserve the original missing-selection/root-only distinction. Inspect correct CORE_META_MODEL versus PROJECT_CONFIGURATION ownership before any authoring; existing folder layout is not authority.

G03 — Terminology resolves meaning before Subject assignment. S043/S045 provide literal clarification, while S046/S049–S051 preserve the distinction between a Term, its defined Entity target and governors. S050 withdraws an unnecessary confidence-reference edit through current historical authority. Do not add a meta-Term layer or discard a self-reference based on spelling alone.

G04 — Use admitted operations rather than inventing an undefined Transition Entity. C005/C006 and S052/S053 preserve an operation/result distinction and admit composite Actions/Workflows/Steps. S054–S056 keep the narrow candidate repair and Status separation. These are provisional operational refinements pending deduplication against current sources.

G05 — Focused questions and independent safe work under a fixed acceptance gate. S002–S007 show independent preview review before a genuine unresolved-choice stop; S015/S032/S040–S042 distinguish answered decisions, semantic questions and remaining implementation work. C013/C014 preserve the full goal. Neither historical blocking language nor a requested next question authorizes a current blocker bypass.

G06 — Preserve source/candidate separation and coverage-aware review evidence. C017–C019 retain byte/path safeguards and the nineteen-ID candidate/original distinction. S003/S004/S013/S024/S030/S031/S051/S055/S056 retain previews, stage-specific test totals, pending migration and original preservation. A test count or written review alone cannot satisfy complete semantic/Carrier coverage.

These six groups refine A1021/A1016 candidates; none is an adopted Operation, current implementation proof or execution instruction. P1119/P1130 must deduplicate against current authority, disposition each candidate, bind CORE_META_MODEL or PROJECT_CONFIGURATION ownership and obtain the required independent review before implementation.

### Actual continuation and complete retained frontier

Coverage is 1,134/1,175; 41 selected-source records remain. Actual next Active P1311/A1029 at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/03_plan/15-CA-P-1117-EPIC--harvest-and-implement-session-derived-operations/01-CA-P-1118-TASK--harvest-the-thirty-day-session-evidence/04-CA-P-1128-TASK--harvest-the-third-session-evidence-partition/20-CA-P-1311-TASK--harvest-the-final-selected-source-third-partition-validation-packet.md` binds all 41 whole remaining selected records at positions 1135–1175, 29467 raw bytes/9,906 native characters and 53 complete antecedents/16622 characters: 26528 total. Including the whole partition-4 boundary record adds 701 characters, giving 27,229 characters and 95 whole records in the preparation envelope. Exact next aggregate SHA256 2c1025a5cb65294c6e2aab87c39ff591ff34020fad02e75ba0fe408c334d5458. Binding adds zero coverage; future completion leaves zero in this selected third source, while all other source frontiers remain unfinished.

First next L57204/[829108079,829109103), 2026-09-27T23:01:02.885Z, raw SHA256 76a74c4050dd0dc00e2b1f2f00a0f59f2cb78b050c8dbc90de366374c5106f31 remains wholly unprocessed. Last bound L59916 is the unchanged final third record. The next whole canonical record L60063/[844267412,844268580), 2026-09-28T01:57:37.689Z, assistant/null/partition 4/701 characters/raw SHA256 b9b5fcd044898d5ffd7345f77a49743bbe9ee25b76ba8db2763f39075ea864a7 remains outside this partition and unprocessed.

P1307 directly BLOCKS P1311 and P1119/P1130/P1155. P1311 and Active P1128 retain those three direct downstream gates. The three downstream v1 Active objectives were fully reread and remain full-harvest/current-authority/exact-destination gated. No stage is unlocked.

All exact A905/A910/A1016/A1021/P1128 frontiers remain: the 1,659-file/1,657-ID corpus; other 1,657 files/fifteen other PRIMARY files/1,642 worker origins; structure continuation/repository/worktree and metadata parent-chain support; both main paths/non-third partitions; twelve limited prepartition matches without global deduplication/file exclusion; nine environment exclusions and sparse gaps. Original August 22 source remains 97,888 records/644,432,542 bytes, zero third-partition records, greatest 2026-09-15T15:24:51.068Z. Final third L59916/[842689409,842690140), 2026-09-28T01:50:11.416Z/raw SHA256 a910f284acb38e377e24f569e31e63a27826374c0a67d928cfea1ee3fff10090 remains below exclusive cutoff 2026-09-28T01:54:15Z. A917 retains its 5,865,276-byte prefix SHA256 4f9d453d6cbbb76f50573c64b73c3b0f2b2d77e502b9ae955ae1c93b055ea49f, zero monthly canonical messages and sole-window L1570 metadata; broader C294 identity remains unasserted/nonblocking. No source or copied worker human intent is subtracted/adopted; frozen evidence and post-cutoff amendments remain distinct.

### Verification and timing

The required single frozen-prefix/native/saved/current-source/Carrier/local-DAG proof and truthful terminal receipt are recorded after persistence. No elapsed<=900 assertion is used as a completion gate; the estimate remains <=15 minutes and any actual overrun will be disclosed in C327 without resetting the original clock.

### Single full proof and actual timing receipt

The same full frozen-prefix/native/saved/current-source/Carrier/local-DAG proof passed at 2026-10-04T10:44:37.879604+00:00, 1002.88seconds from original firstclock2026-10-04 10:27:55UTC. It matched1,095,406,718frozen bytes/fullSHA256, all56selected/23context parts and79 substantive dispositions, next41records/53antecedents/wholepartition4boundary,26 unchanged current source fingerprints/revisions, strict YAML/headings/EOF/whitespace, unique owned/reserved IDs/sibling sequence, immediate P1128 decomposition, physical Done and nine local completion-DAG nodes. A1029 is unused; P1311 remains Active/unexecuted and binding adds zero coverage.

The first attempt rejected a complete short context disposition through an arbitrary minimum-length assertion. Removing that unsupported criterion recovered the same proof without padding or another semantic review stage. C327 retains this and prior read/orchestration failures. Two closure patches were rejected before writing: one repeated a parent-file operation; the next put an earlier Objective hunk after a later Details hunk. Consolidating operations and ordering hunks recovered persistence. A broad diagnostic capture was rejected on output limits; bounded header inspection recovered it.

Actual closure-persistence clock2026-10-04 10:48:00 +0000, 1205seconds from unchanged10:27:55UTC, exceeds the900-second estimate by305seconds. No timely-completion claim or clock reset. C327 remains active/nonblocking for the process overrun; reading/orchestration/verification failures are resolved. Required output is complete, P1307 physicallyDone, P1128 Active, coverage1,134/1,175/41remaining. Hold without another leaf. Root owns sharedcheckpoint/save/Git/Journal.

## TLDR

Fifty-six whole records and twenty-three full antecedents retain every literal correction, supersession and candidate/report boundary. The next 41-record packet is concretely bound but unexecuted; P1128 stays Active with all corpus/frontier gates.
