# Summary

Reuse current CA-O-010 v7 and CA-O-011 v10; no new Source Reconciliation Workflow is needed. Both are owned by CORE_META_MODEL. Their source Carrier headings violate CA-D-479 v6; CA-C-350 records a later meaning-preserving layout repair. Independent acceptance passed; CA-P-1340 closes only this bounded reconciliation, not the unperformed repair or downstream gates.

## Question

Does completed-evidence candidate C02 require new Operations, and which authority owns its reusable flow, methodology binding and actual gaps?

## Scope

Only CA-A-924 C02, D03–D04 and their saved supporting dispositions are reconciled with both full current source Workflows. No native sessions, Operation/RMED authoring, runtime execution, settings, code, Journal or Git changes. Closed-corpus controls are CA-P-1117 v2 / CA-P-1119 v2 / CA-P-1130 v3: 102 completed packets / 5,463 records; partial CA-A-1043 and canceled harvesting are excluded. Other candidate families and consolidation remain unfinished.

## Approach

The producer fully read the bound Plan, saved candidate/decisions and supporting dispositions, both current Workflows and CA-D-479 v6. The previously fully read Goal v13, 14 active Project Principles and bound governing-carrier revisions were reused only after their 26 authority fingerprints matched; amended closed-corpus controls were reopened. Source Operations, not generated Applicable Methodology projections, decide ownership. The table compares actual clauses rather than treating historical change reports as adoption or runtime proof.

### Proposition-to-authority dispositions

Evidence locators are A924's retained S-record dispositions, not newly read native records. Historical human assent is bound only to its immediate historical proposal.

| Evidence reference / proposition | Current authority clause | Disposition and exact destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C02 L284; S031 L193, S033 L195, S035 L197; D03 L268: abstract flow must select, detect and fix conflicts, not merely select an AM-specific Type. | O010 v7 L36, L44–49: reusable Workflow with six Steps referencing O004–O009; O011 v10 L39 binds it without duplicated Actions or Workflow-as-Action invocation. | Already covered: reuse O010 in CORE_META_MODEL and O011 in CORE_META_MODEL. Do not create another generic Workflow or infer adoption of the superseded S030/S032 classifications. |
| C02; S032 L194 / S034 L196: select applicable source revisions. | O010 L38/L44/L57–58; O011 L43: R1228 registered sources, activated/selected revisions, Core + Project Configuration + applicable installed Extensions, exactly one active current revision per eligible Atom under R1315, no unknown conforming omission. | Already covered: O010 generic selection plus O011 reusable AM input binding. Registered Carrier discovery and empty-Extension behavior remain intact; no named-Extension or project-specific selection hardcode. |
| S033 L195 / S034 L196 / S036 L198: detect conflicts before resolution/publication. | O010 L45/L59–61; O011 L44: R1375 boundary and R1373 conflict assessment, retain conflicting Atoms, deterministic frontier digest and complete conflict set before membership change. | Already covered: reuse the assess Step and O011's Core-bound conflict policy. Incomplete assessment or unavailable authority stops; no conflict filtering by source order. |
| S034 L196 / S036 L198: propose upstream fixes and obtain approval. S045 L207 / D04 L269 approves historical extraction, not a later source correction. | O010 L46–47/L62–67; O011 L45–46: separate owning-authority proposal; R1317/O007 exactly one unambiguous actual Operator Journal approval bound to the exact proposal, conflict set and frontier digest; stale/partial/mismatched approval fails and cannot bypass Core boundaries. | Already covered: reuse O010 proposal/decision and O011 binding. Historical S045 is not current approval. Neither synthesized precedence, LLM inference nor Project Configuration approval Atoms resolve these conflicts. |
| S035 L197 / S036 L198 / S042 L204: apply approved corrections and reassess the resulting frontier. | O010 L48/L64–69; O011 L47: correction is a separately authorized source-change workflow, never compiler side effect or projected Claim editing; every change returns to select and reassess; partial/failed correction cannot publish the earlier assessment. | Already covered: CORE_META_MODEL O010/O011 govern the flow; actual changes belong to the affected source's authorized change workflow. No upstream fix is performed or authorized by this Analysis. |
| S036 L198 / S042 L204: publish a conflict-resolved content-preserving result. S014 L176 supplies preservation direction. | O010 L49/L59/L70–72; O011 L48: R1314/R1316 retain every ID, exact Revision, owner and Claim; R1461/D305/D306 source identity/Carrier bytes/form; same resolved frontier yields same ordered membership; unresolved conflict/invalid approval fails without membership change. | Already covered: reuse publication binding in O011 and generic publication in O010. Source references establish the contract, not a new independent inspection of every referenced R/D Carrier or runtime output. |
| S019 L181 / S020; S023 L184: distinguish derivation from Carrier materialization; no dbt dependency was authorized. | O010 L44–49 separates frontier work from the selected Projection Delivery authority at publish; O011 L43–48 separates source selection/assessment from exact source-preserving publication. | Operational separation already covered. General terminology/formal Type claims are deferred to separately bound RMED reconciliation, not another Operation or dbt implementation. No referenced R/D definition is newly adopted here. |
| S044–S045 L206–207 / D04 L269: extract reusable workflow while retaining methodology-specific constraints; S051 L213 / S055 L217 report six Actions and preserved compilation name. | O010 L36/L44–49; O011 L39–50: reusable Applicable Methodology Compilation binding, named target preserved, complete specialized constraints, inherited entry/Action/ON_RESULT/run boundaries. Both live owners are CORE_META_MODEL. | Already covered. Reject C02's historical PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination for the generic AM binding. A caprmedio-specific migration remains distinct and deferred to a later PROJECT_CONFIGURATION Plan if actually needed; no such migration is authored or executed. |
| S080 L242 reports preserved approval/conflict/retry behavior; it is not an independent test receipt. | O010 L74: effective confidence and authorization gates, accepted run retry/escalation budget, reselection/new conflict does not reset it, absent/exhausted allowance stops, no skipped reassessment/unresolved publication/automatic correction. O011 L50 inherits those boundaries. | Already covered by live definition; reported historical preservation remains evidence only. Runtime/implementation verification and assurance-case execution are deferred, not passed by hashes or this table. |
| S047–S048 L209–210 / D04 L269: one historical deferred-commit exception for a specific replacement request. | O010 L63/L67/L74 and O011 L45–47 require exact governing authorization; neither defines a reusable Git bypass. P1340 expressly forbids Git/Journal writes. | Rejected as a general/current exception. Retain the historical scoped decision only; no commit authority or current staged-state claim is derived. |
| Current source layout, independent of historical S050's old missing-token report. | D479 v6 requires one literal `# Summary`, then Operations' `## Operation` and `## Details`. O010 instead has descriptive H1/Steps/Transitions; O011 descriptive H1/unsectioned table; neither has the required three headings. | Adopted gap: typed CA-C-350. Exact later repair targets are the two current CORE_META_MODEL source files above, not projections. No semantic Operation gap or current missing-token issue is inferred from S050. |

### Decision and retained follow-up

Reuse both Operations without semantic edits. R owns governing source-selection, authority, approval and preservation contracts; E owns functional assurance/checks; D owns registered Carrier layout and output Delivery; M describes construction technique, not executable flow. This ownership distinction does not adopt new RMED atoms. Later authoring must repair only the C350 layout while preserving all Step/Action references, transitions, stops, confidence/authorization gates, retry budget, exact approval cardinality/frontier digest, source preservation, ownership and revisions. Root must bind that work and its preservation review separately; no O/RMED authoring or implementation is complete here. P1341–P1344, P1345 consolidation, parent P1130/P1119 and P1131/P1156 readiness remain in force.

### Verification and clock

First execution: **2026-10-04 12:34:57 UTC**; estimate <=15 minutes, never reset. Two preparation patches failed exact-line/hunk-order matching and wrote no files; corrected saves retain the same clock. A broad hash-target lookup included projections/archives and failed its uniqueness assertion; exact bound source paths recovered it without treating those other Carriers as authority.

Producer structural observation passed **2026-10-04 12:49:26 UTC**, 869 seconds from first execution: nine unique strict duplicate-rejecting YAML/registered-heading Carriers, required fields/one EOF newline/no trailing whitespace, seven-node acyclic local Plan DAG, P1155 physically Done and P1340 Active, saved-result reopen and all three exact comparison hashes unchanged. Cached existing parser only; no verification machinery was created. This is not independent functional acceptance.

Independent checker: **/root**, not the producer. Receipt **PASS, 2026-10-04 12:50 UTC**: root reopened the full A1058 table, A924 S013–S080 / D02–D04 / C02, both full current O010 v7 and O011 v10, and C350. All 11 dispositions trace to evidence and live clauses. Generic Applicable Methodology binding belongs CORE_META_MODEL; the historical PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination is not current adoption. Exact Operator approval, upstream correction/reselection, preservation and retry boundaries remain intact; the historical Git exception is not generalized. C350 correctly records unperformed layout repair only. Root explicitly authorized bounded P1340 closure after this receipt.

Physical Done persistence observed **2026-10-04 12:51:30 UTC**, 993 seconds from the original 12:34:57 start: **93 seconds over the 900-second estimate**. This includes preparation recovery, awaiting independent acceptance and saving its receipt; the clock was never reset. P1340 is physically placed under its immediate parent's done/ only after the independent pass. C350 remains Active and separately bound authoring/preservation checks, RMED/runtime work and all other parent/consolidation/authoring gates remain unfinished.

## TLDR

Current CORE_META_MODEL O010/O011 already cover C02. Reject the historical generic-binding destination override and blanket Git exception; retain separately bound terminology/migration/RMED/runtime follow-up. C350 records the real two-Carrier layout gap. Independent acceptance passed; P1340 is Done with a disclosed overrun, while downstream authoring gates remain open.
