# Summary

Harvest the first third-partition main-session packet

## Question

Which reusable operational candidates, Operator decisions and supersessions occur in the 12 complete messages bound by CA-P-1182, and what remains unprocessed?

## Scope

Exactly 12 canonical visible primary user/assistant `response_item` messages, 4419 text characters, from main session `01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6`. Source: `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl`. Sparse lines 23945–24030; byte envelope [511906569,512494504); event timestamps 2026-09-20T15:31:43.150Z–2026-09-20T15:43:33.998Z. All actual channels are null. The partition remains [2026-09-20T01:54:15Z,2026-09-28T01:54:15Z); later Operator amendments do not move this cutoff.

The packet is historical content evidence, not current Operation authority or proof of implemented behavior. Tool/internal records, intervening payloads, event mirrors and environment carriers were not substantively read. The next packet was bound by exact metadata/hash checks without harvesting its contents. No O/RMED, code, environment or Docker changes are made by this Analysis.

## Approach

Read CA-P-1117 v1, CA-P-1182 v1, CA-P-1128 v3, completed CA-P-1153 v3 and CA-A-905 v1's source/frontier declaration. Before content reading, reread external Goal v13; active Project Principles CA-R-819 v13, CA-R-1490 v1, CA-R-1407 v5, CA-R-1420 v5, CA-R-1421 v4, CA-R-1423 v4, CA-M-001 v10, CA-M-002 v15, CA-M-005 v8, CA-M-006 v8, CA-M-261 v5, CA-E-001 v12; legacy Actor Principles CA-P-032 v5 and CA-P-033 v9; permission Core CA-P-034 v6. Authoritative Plan sources under `000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL` were CA-R-1589 v4, CA-R-1580 v4, CA-D-460 v6, CA-D-470 v7 and CA-D-481 v4; Done placement uses CA-D-461 v6. Revisions matched the incoming binding.

System Python standard-library checks sought only the declared complete raw lines, verified raw SHA-256 including newline, canonical type/role/channel/timestamp and full text length, then exposed every selected message in full. Every record below has its own substantive disposition. Human statements remain Operator evidence; assistant specificity remains a proposal or historical report except where subsequent Operator input adopts it. No selected record is copied worker context; references to earlier Change Status discussion are treated as context with an unconsumed provenance boundary.

## Results

Processed coverage is exactly **12/12 messages and 4419/4419 text characters**. This is 12/1175 canonical visible records in this continuation's third partition; 1163 remain substantively unprocessed. Five reusable candidate groups were extracted. Naming discussion, superseded wording and historical progress reports remain individually accounted for rather than becoming extra independent decisions.

### Per-message evidence and decision dispositions

| Disposition / exact source line | Evidence and operational intent | Authority, correction or no-new-candidate disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D01 / 23945 | Operator distinguishes in-session and isolated workflows; MCP should return the output and a prompt telling the session what to do next so it need not remember the procedure. | Direct human proposal for self-contained handoffs. Its initial Workflow-level classification is narrowed by D06/D07; handoff intent remains. |
| D02 / 23950 | Assistant proposes Workflow Run execution modes, Run ID/outcome/results/next-input/resume fields, Orchestrator-held state, definition-supplied instructions, and a Change Status → Repair Relations example; returned prompts do not expand permission. | Assistant elaboration. Workflow-level mode placement is superseded by D06/D07. Detailed field contract, state ownership and separate Repair Run are candidate specificity, not independently proven authority. The example references earlier discussion outside this packet. |
| D03 / 23957 | Operator asks for better names and suggests open/close or wide/deep. | Naming request, no independent workflow/action candidate. Suggested names are exploratory, not adopted. |
| D04 / 23962 | Assistant proposes Integrated/Isolated, contrasts session-bound/detached and shared/separate context, and warns autonomous may confuse context with permission. | Integrated/Isolated terminology is used by the Operator in D05/D06. Alternative names are unadopted; Run-level attachment is superseded. No separate naming Operation is inferred. |
| D05 / 23969 | Operator distinguishes programmatic/agentic Actions and first phrases a Step as an Action in integrated/isolated context. | Human formulation superseded immediately by the more precise D06; retain both records, not two decisions. |
| D06 / 23977 | Operator corrects the wording to “STEP can execute agentic action” in integrated or isolated ways. | Latest direct human correction places the distinction on Step execution of an Agentic Action. It supersedes D05 and earlier Workflow-wide mode placement. |
| D07 / 23982 | Assistant interprets invocation at Step level; programmatic means code, agentic requires AI Agent and may use Tools; current or separate Agent context receives inputs/prompt and returns result; definitions can be reused and one Workflow can mix kinds. | Consistent assistant interpretation, broadly accepted by D10. Exact implementation contracts remain candidates for CA-P-1130 reconciliation, not current implementation proof. |
| D08 / 23989 | Operator proposes that every Tool call in an agentic Step Run is a sub-step and asks for objections. | Human proposal is open to correction. Automatic sub-step identity is superseded by D09, accepted by D10. |
| D09 / 23994 | Assistant distinguishes one Action per Step from nested Tool calls; proposes parent Step Run, inputs, outcome and errors in Journal; separate routing/check/approval boundary can justify an explicit Step. | Accepted historical direction under D10. Tool calls are execution details, not automatically declared Workflow nodes. Trace fields and promotion criterion are proposed operational detail needing current authority mapping. |
| D10 / 24001 | Operator says “good” and authorizes updating Atoms for Workflow/Step/Action discussion. | Historical acceptance of the corrected model and trace distinction, with authority to author at that time. It does not prove the update occurred or authorize fresh O/RMED authoring in this harvest leaf. |
| D11 / 24004 | Assistant promises methodology Atom updates for Action kinds, modes and nested traces, plus previously agreed Change Status/relation-repair behavior, without building Tools. | No new candidate beyond contextual H908-C5; promise is not a completion report, save receipt, current authority verification or implementation evidence. Earlier Change Status agreement is outside this packet. |
| D12 / 24030 | Assistant reports model fit and a conflict: an Active Task may depend on a Done Task; says it will ask while updating independent rules. | No new model candidate; corroborates discussion only. Reported conflict is unverified historical evidence, not a currently encountered Conflict. Later CA-P-1130 must check active authority and the subsequent reply before adopting any resolution. No current Concern is invented from this report. |

### Reusable candidate groups and acceptance boundaries

These five packet-local IDs are candidates, not Atom IDs or adopted current methodology. CA-P-1130 owns mapping to current authority, semantic deduplication, destination choice and adopted/already-covered/rejected disposition after substantive harvest gates complete.

1. **H908-C1 — Step invocation model.** Reuse one Action definition across invocations. Distinguish Programmatic and Agentic Actions, with Integrated/Isolated invocation for a Step executing an Agentic Action; allow a Workflow to combine those Step kinds. Sources D01–D07/D10/D12. D06 is the controlling human correction; D07 elaborates and D10 accepts the discussion. Do not retain the earlier Workflow-wide mode taxonomy as a second canonical model.
2. **H908-C2 — Integrated session handoff and continuation.** At the participation boundary, return relevant output plus a self-contained prompt with inputs/references and how to submit/resume; the current session performs the Action and returns its result. Candidate MCP payload fields are Run ID, outcome, findings, next instruction and resume contract. State stays with the Orchestrator and instructions with the definition, avoiding duplicate procedure memory. Sources D01/D02/D06/D07/D10. Core handoff intent is direct Operator evidence; detailed fields/state placement are accepted-discussion specificity requiring reconciliation. Prompts do not confer permission.
3. **H908-C3 — Isolated Agentic Action invocation.** Give a separate Agent context the same Action's inputs and prompt and collect its result; contextual handoffs or Operator-input requests remain possible. Sources D02/D06/D07/D10. Separate context is direct human direction; final-result/request contracts are assistant detail. This is execution-context choice, not a new grant of autonomous authority.
4. **H908-C4 — Nested Tool-call trace and explicit Step boundary.** Record Tool calls under their parent Step Run, with inputs/outcome/errors in Journal. Promote an operation to a declared Step when it needs its own Workflow routing, checks or approval boundary; a call does not automatically become a sub-step. Sources D08/D09/D10/D12. D10 accepts the objection and corrected direction; D08's automatic classification is superseded. Trace/promotion details await current-source mapping.
5. **H908-C5 — Change Status/relation-repair workflow context.** D02 gives Change Status completion → broken Relations plus next instruction → separate Repair Relations Run; D11 promises previously agreed behavior. This is a contextual candidate, **not adopted from this packet**: its earlier human authorization, exact behavior and any later change remain unconsumed source evidence owned by the appropriate historical frontiers. It supplies a main-session handoff example only, not proof of implementation or authority edits.

No complete user-facing Operator-input prompt is authored in this packet. H908-C2 is a continuation-prompt contract and H908-C3 mentions an input request; record that distinction instead of inventing literal reusable prompt text. No independently evidenced Process beyond the Workflow/Step/Action model and handoff/trace candidates is inferred.

### Exact remaining frontiers and readiness

CA-P-1192 is the actual next sibling harvest leaf under CA-P-1128, one AI Agent, <=15 minutes. It binds the next 12 complete records, 4613 text characters, sparse lines 24053–24151, byte envelope [512649985,513524656), timestamps 2026-09-20T15:47:21.583Z–2026-09-20T16:13:01.519Z, and reserves `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-913-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-second-third-partition-main-session-packet.md`. Its first raw hash is `9b53c9e500e88051d71310a5be19530c155e477f8b68cec052f43f80f1067f3f`. The next packet is bound, not substantively processed by CA-P-1182.

All 1163 remaining canonical visible records are retained through line 59916, bytes [842689409,842690140), timestamp 2026-09-28T01:50:11.416Z, hash `a910f284acb38e377e24f569e31e63a27826374c0a67d928cfea1ee3fff10090`. CA-P-1192 must create its next actual leaf before closing; after its bound 12 messages, 1151 remain beginning at line 24154, bytes [513525714,513526240), timestamp 2026-09-20T16:13:05.655Z, assistant/channel null, hash `e998a3a4fcc5e79b6ee2519f1becc583454880936be1d7d95d5d8643b6fec22d`. Sparse gaps, non-message records and nine excluded environment carriers remain source evidence with the inherited timestamp-window/filter disposition; they are excluded from canonical visible-message counts, not deleted or claimed substantively processed. No intervening Tool/internal payload was admitted by byte-envelope wording.

Retain the original main file `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/08/22/rollout-2026-08-22T01-53-53-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6.jsonl` and the continuation as separate source rows. CA-P-1153 established zero third-partition events in the original, whose last event is 2026-09-15T15:24:51.068Z; its non-third-partition frontiers remain with their partition owners. The limited 12 matching content signatures from its last 30 visible records into pre-partition continuation records do not establish global deduplication or authorize dropping either file.

CA-A-905 v1 remains authoritative for all 1659 retained rows/1657 IDs. The other 1657 rows, other 15 primary files, structure continuation pair, verified historical repository/metadata parent-chain sources and 1642 worker files retain exact admission/availability/body/frozen-window frontiers. CA-C-294's candidate identity check remains unprocessed; copied worker context does not create an independent Operator decision. The temporary index supplies selection offsets/hashes only; original sources and CA-A-905 remain authoritative.

CA-P-1182 BLOCKS CA-P-1192. CA-P-1192 BLOCKS CA-P-1119, CA-P-1130 and CA-P-1155. CA-P-1128 remains Active and retains its direct gates; the CA-P-1118 stage gate also remains. The downstream Plan objectives were reviewed: reconciliation requires full harvest/current-source mapping and its preflight must consume actual results; this packet does not authorize their execution while remainder gates persist. D12's historical issue and H908-C5's missing prior adoption are retained for CA-P-1130 rather than duplicated as new current Concerns. No current permission/evidence/runtime/authority blocker or below-threshold decision was encountered.

### Functional verification

Input check passed before content reading: all 12 complete records, hashes, canonical message types, roles/channels, timestamps and 4419 text characters matched CA-P-1182. Post-save exact-source checks passed again for those records and for CA-P-1192's 12 records/4613 characters and first frontier hash; the following line24154 hash also matched. Saved-result reconciliation passed all12 unique line/hash keys, D01–D12 evidence rows and valid H908-C1–C5 references. Four saved carriers passed required headings/properties, immediate decomposition/Done placement, exact one-final-newline and trailing-whitespace checks; retained parent/remainder gates were confirmed. Unique live A908/P1192 and unauthored A913 reservation checks passed. After correcting the diagnostic scan to include the governing Epic file beside its folder, the complete observed 67-Plan/180-explicit-edge BLOCKS/decomposition graph was acyclic. The first scan's missing Epic node was a diagnostic scope error, not an authority/source defect. Recorded verification is standard-library structural/functional verification, not unavailable full YAML parsing under CA-C-293. Completed within <=15 minutes. No Git, save-Tool receipt or Journal provenance is claimed.

## TLDR

The substantive harvest covers exactly the bound 12 messages. Step-level invocation and nested Tool-call trace are the historically accepted corrected direction; assistant implementation detail remains subject to current-authority reconciliation. The actual next leaf and full unprocessed corpus/frontiers remain explicit. Authority authoring and implementation remain later gated work.
