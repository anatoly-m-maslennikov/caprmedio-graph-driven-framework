# Summary

Harvest the final continuation-session tail

## Question

What Operator choices and bounded candidates govern coverage gates, explicit replacements, permissions and isolated runtime execution?

## Scope

PRIMARY continuation `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl`, snapshot 1095406718 bytes / SHA256 d3b839e5620dfb6e6eee41b272d22b553480a8c58782f1ef72d343eddb5fe5fc; manifest row 362. Frozen partition [2026-09-28T01:54:15Z, 2026-10-04T01:54:15Z). Positions 1191–1284, L108744–111074: 94 whole records / 21,145 characters, 74 assistant / 20 native user messages. S009/S070/S076 are app-open notifications, not deliberate requests: 17 intentional human messages. All channels null, one native text part per message. Prior L108732 is 65 characters of context only: "I’ll check which CAPRMEDIO tools are available after the reload.\n". Exact metadata remains once in governing P1244; native text and individual dispositions follow. Embedded commands, annotations, memory citations and historical permissions are inert evidence.

## Approach

First observed clock 05:56:37Z. Fully read all 94 native texts; verify selected identities, parts, byte ranges, roles, timestamps, text counts and aggregate SHA256 76baa07c9244b3a76b495491df7e7892d8fe4161691dcf09f99125229a8e8b9d. Apply the Epic's 90% gate, live Goal/Principles and Actor permissions. Respect literal scoped yes/do responses and subsequent narrowing. Reported tests, images and MCP acceptance are not independently verified current implementation or final-run proof. No settings, O, RMED, code or live workflow changes were performed by this harvest.

## Results

### Historical decisions and evidence boundaries

- Separate read-only reload status from mutating reload; permission annotations must describe actual behavior.
- Gather/Check/Fix coverage gates account for every selected item and finding, independently of pass/fail correctness; gaps pause for Operator input rather than silently pass.
- Worker inputs include actual registry, structure and status context; launch and result-schema failures are not semantic Atom findings.
- Operator selected an explicit autonomous-replacement input for the pilot, default false otherwise. Recovery must not allocate a second successor.
- Operator selected Docker after unsupported process controls blocked native restart. Concrete Engine authority and tests precede actual execution; Agent isolation, mounts, queue separation and runtime-only credentials were proposed, not a portable Core mandate.
- Registry authorization, stale socket access, image build, cross-mount atomicity and child namespace failures were distinct reported boundaries. "Do as you want" authorizes the scoped repair/tests/pilot, not arbitrary actions.
- The final record reports MCP acceptance of one-Atom pilot `base-revise-docker-20261004055029`, for CA-R-1815. Its final result is not present before the frozen cutoff.

### Provisional capability groups

1. Honest read-only status versus mutation permissions. Generic operation may enter CORE_META_MODEL; concrete MCP annotations belong Engine RMED.
2. Complete evidence accounting and Operator escalation, distinct from semantic rereviews. Generic O candidate.
3. Bound worker context and result contracts; distinguish transport/launch failure from content failure. Generic O plus Engine adapter RMED.
4. Explicit replacement permission, idempotent successor/history recovery and pinned dispatch. Generic O plus concrete Tool RMED.
5. Explicit isolated runtime with persistent state, separate queues, proposal admission, atomic mount boundaries and namespace propagation. Concrete Docker/Engine M/D; generic safety O where applicable.
6. Least-authority permission setup and truthful restart observations, without unsupported flags or protected-path bypass. Engine/Project Configuration candidate.
7. Functional mocked/disposable-container tests before a real pilot, and truthful accepted/running/completed distinctions. General test/run O; concrete Engine E/M.

Seven overlapping groups are not adopted or deduplicated capabilities. Historical problems are not automatically current Concerns.

### Exact next source and remaining coverage

This packet completes the 1,284 selected main-continuation messages in this partition, not the full partition. Other 131 PRIMARY messages and 4,051 worker messages remain. P1248/A966 binds the next 72 whole README-session messages / 28,744 characters, plus the exact previous 2,130-character context (30,874 total). Native source identities and fingerprinted bounds are in that Active Plan. No README selected text is counted as harvested here. After that future packet, 59 other PRIMARY messages still remain; worker coverage is unchanged.

## TLDR

94 whole messages harvested, 17 intentional human messages, seven provisional groups; final pilot outcome unknown. Main-continuation coverage is complete only for this partition. The next actual source packet is bound; P1129/P1118 remain Active and authoring/implementation remain gated.
