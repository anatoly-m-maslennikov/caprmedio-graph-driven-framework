## Summary

Compare and add numeric values in CFEL

## Claim

- `x > y`: x is greater than y.
- `x >= y`: x is greater than or equal to y.
- `x < y`: x is less than y.
- `x <= y`: x is less than or equal to y.
- `x + y` returns the numeric sum of two numeric operands. If both operands are integers, the result is an exact integer.
- Each operand resolves to one numeric value. No string coercion is allowed.
- Evaluate `+` before `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=`. Parentheses override this order.
- `=` tests equality, including in a Claim invariant; it does not assign a value.
- A missing or multi-valued operand makes an evaluated comparison invalid.
- Guard optional Properties by their occurrence before comparing their values.
- A comparison in Claim must hold. In an IF condition, it tests the values.
- An IF conclusion is evaluated only when its condition holds.
- A Declaration applies the comparison to each matching instance.
- Comparisons do not assign values or change occurrence counts.
- `+>`, `<+`, `>|` and `|<` remain distinct Relation operators.
