# Summary

Reconcile settings before derived structure

## Question

Do saved A1031 G4 and A1035 G1 require new reusable Operations, or are their settings, structure, capability and factual-history boundaries covered by current authority?

## Scope

Only the two saved candidate groups admitted by CA-P-1343, under Operator-closed Epic1117 v2 / P1119 v2 / P1130 v2. No native session or new harvest was opened. No partial A1043, other candidate group, runtime, secret, settings value, source Atom, code, Journal or Git change is admitted. The unchanged first actual clock is 2026-10-04 12:24:51 UTC; estimate <=15 minutes. Confidence threshold90%; current authority resolves the bounded dispositions without an Operator decision.

## Approach

Fully read the bound Plan, controls, Goal13, all14 current active Project Principles, O052 v4 and supporting live source authorities listed below. Read both saved group sections and the relevant complete saved originals, not a native session. The table separates reusable authority from historical reports and execution evidence. DRY M002 v15 and M005 v8 require reusing O052 rather than a second resolver; M001 v10 preserves every bound proposition; M006 v8 preserves settings/structure/history coherence; P033 v9, P034 v6 and R1799 v1 prevent capability wording from expanding authorization.

### Exact saved evidence

- `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1031-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-next-second-partition-review-boundary-packet.md`, v1, Results / Provisional reusable refinements / G4 (line51). Literal group: “Preserve capability/configuration ownership and execution boundaries. R832 supplies Project-level configuration capability while Settings owns current Extension activation and selected revisions. This does not authorize runtime or secret access, redefine meanings, or create a second configuration owner. It refines A1027's Carrier/Settings separation and broader capability group.”
- In that saved JSON `messages`, L10280, assistant, 2026-09-17T15:58:57.957Z: “The recorded repair batches pass source/archive verification and whitespace checks. I also clarified R-832: configuration remains a Project capability, but current Extension activation and selected revisions stay in Settings.\n\nThe broader audit is still open. Uncertain Type, backlog, logging, structural-binding, and root-placement findings are preserved as Concerns; the remaining Project and implementation-scope findings are next.”
  Raw-record SHA256 `9a423820827bc51092d6bafb9a24ed505fca9112d5ab1f45d2a9b492c3e12bc4`; text SHA256 `3c59c5a9e6932e3f237a39bcc2000c7b9105d35e347afd51d6dc5bd2c9b92d13`. This is a historical assistant report, not fresh repair or acceptance evidence.
- `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1035-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-following-second-partition-review-boundary-packet.md`, v1, Results / Provisional reusable refinements / G1 (line47). Literal group: “Preserve authoritative configuration and factual evidence boundaries. Per-unit Authority Mode overrides come from Project Structure; observations are Journal records, while O Atoms define policies or executable behavior. This refines A1031 capability/Settings and factual-record separation without claiming a current migration.”
- In that saved JSON `messages`, L10337, assistant, 2026-09-17T16:02:37.133Z: “The current authority settles two corrections: per-unit Authority Mode overrides come from Project Structure, and observations belong in the Journal—not in O definition Atoms.\n\nI also found two self-contained policies with no incoming active references: Concern-resolution permission belongs to `O/Actor`, and short-name screening belongs to `O/Action`.”
  Raw-record SHA256 `b40f7482e3a0ce985a28b9d13975456bd5404050768f69b4f01bf4e3bac040ef`; text SHA256 `f3fa085ff3139602ff2f3b562aba747865773d143dfea7467a28a8eb1a303ec8`. Its final paragraph belongs to A1035 G2, not this assigned G1; neither self-containment nor no-incoming-reference assertions are independently adopted here. The saved A1035 context repeats A1031 L10280; it is overlapping evidence, not another proposition or new coverage.
- Neither group carries fresh literal human adoption. The historical verification reports, inherited wrappers and saved citations are source material, never present authorization or functional proof.

## Results

### Complete proposition-to-authority disposition

“Covered” means current semantic authority covers the proposition, not that its Implementation or runtime has been tested in this leaf. O052 does not independently own every related setting or Journal rule; it invokes the governing boundaries below.

| ID | Bound proposition or resolver clause | Current exact coverage | Disposition / destination |
|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | G4: provide configuration capability to select/combine/parameterize/disable optional canonical and Extension capabilities | Project R832 v12 first paragraph defines capability within declared configuration boundaries; R1421 v4 preserves configurability. O052 v4 resolves the current inputs, not automatic capability execution. | Existing coverage. Retain R832 as Project authority; no duplicate capability Operation and no automatic mutation. |
| S02 | G4: current Extension activation and selected revisions belong to Settings | R832 v12 second paragraph; CORE R1207 v14 Claim and R1733 v17 distinguish FIS selection ownership from configuration rules and application bindings. O052 step2 resolves effective FIS. | Existing coverage, reusable CORE ownership. Bind to FIS; never put selected current values into Project Configuration Atoms or Extension bindings. |
| S03 | G4: selection capability must not redefine governed meanings | R832 v12 first paragraph explicitly prohibits redefinition; M006 v8 requires coherence. | Existing restriction. Reject an interpretation that configuration silently redefines Terms or Claims. No new O. |
| S04 | G4: no second configuration/settings owner | R1207 v14, R1750 v21 and R1470 v6 assign one owner per independently maintained fact. D366 v8 prohibits Framework Instance choices, authoritative structure and independently editable derived values in Project Settings. O052 final paragraph reuses registered carriers. | Existing coverage. Reject duplicate configuration owners or inherited values copied as explicit choices. |
| S05 | G4: capability does not authorize runtime or secret access | P033 v9 original Operator authority; P034 v6 permits only delegated complete action/target/decision boundary; R1799 v1 capability availability does not trigger execution. O052 defines resolution behavior, not a permission to mutate settings or access secrets/runtime. | Reject automatic settings changes and expanded access. No secret/runtime action was performed. |
| S06 | G4: preserve Carrier/Settings separation | O052 steps1-2 and final paragraph reuse D366 v8 / M279 v8; format/placement are not independently defined by the resolver. R1052 v21 separates inputs, instance choices, declarations and projections. | Existing CORE coverage. Reference registered carriers; no replacement carrier owner. |
| S07 | G1: per-unit Authority Mode overrides come from authoritative Project Structure | R1430 v8 Claim and D374 v7 Claim assign explicit per-unit override only to Project Structure; omitted values inherit effective FIS. O052 step3 uses resolved settings before interpreting authoritative structure. | Existing CORE coverage. Reject legacy per-unit Settings fields as a second selectable source; do not author an omitted override. |
| S08 | G1: observations/execution history are Journal facts, not O definition Atoms | R1470 v6 distinguishes declaration/materialization/history owners; R1712 v16 separates enacted/runtime facts and Journal evidence from governing authority; R1745 v16 defines admitted records as recorded evidence, not the event or automatic proof. R1729 v16 preserves history independently of O lifecycle. | Existing coverage. Interpret “observations are Journal records” as recording factual events/evidence, not declaring a Journal entry identical to the observation or requiring every analytical sentence to become an O/Journal mutation. No current migration is inferred. |
| S09 | G1: O Atoms define policies or executable behavior | R1530 v6 Operations Claim defines reusable Action, Workflow, Step binding or Actor participation/authorization; O052 v4 is one reusable Action, not a factual execution record. | Existing CORE definition and concrete resolver. No replacement O or duplicate Journal policy. |
| S10 | Both groups: refinements do not establish current migration, adopted repair or present verification | E001 v12 requires checkable results; R1712 v16 / R1745 v16 distinguish reported/admitted evidence from outcomes; this leaf's explicit authority is reconciliation only. | Historical reports retained; migration, source/archive tests and implementation success deferred to actual later evidence. No adopted semantic gap. |
| O01 | Resolve both current Project initialization inputs before Project Structure interpretation/derived values | O052 v4 definition and ordered steps1-3. | Existing reusable CORE Action; use this exact Operation identity. |
| O02 | Effective parameter resolution is per-parameter presence, not truthiness | O052 step2 invokes M279 v8: explicit false/zero/empty are present; missing values may inherit defaults; invalid explicit values do not silently fall back; inherited values are not copied as explicit selections. | Reuse M279 rather than duplicate its technique in a new resolver. |
| O03 | Resolve initialization without an existing Project Atom or Implementation | O052 v4 final paragraph expressly forbids those prerequisites. | Existing behavior; later implementation proof must preserve bootstrap use. |
| O04 | No cross-Project fallback or Projection substitution | O052 final paragraph; R1052 v21 distinguishes authority from observations/projections; E446 v12 provides a two-Project assurance case. | Existing CORE constraints; test selected Project isolation later. No projection/settings edit. |
| O05 | Stop when required parameters cannot be resolved | O052 final paragraph invokes M279 v8 missing-required-both-sources stop; optional absent values remain optional. | Existing behavior. A later Action must report/stop, not invent required values. |
| O06 | Reuse registered Settings format/placement, not a second independent definition | O052 final sentence; D366 v8 Project Settings contract; R1750 v21 owner partition. | Existing CORE coverage. No project-specific format or value is introduced. |

### Existing coverage, gap and destinations

Semantic disposition: all10 candidate propositions are covered or their automatic-mutation/adoption interpretations rejected; six O052 resolver clauses are mapped for integration. Zero new Operations and zero adopted semantic RMED gaps are warranted by this packet. “Covered” does not waive later independent review or functional proof.

Reusable destination is the existing O052 source in `000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations`, plus existing CORE R/M/E/D ownership. Preserve its identity, current source relation to R1052 and invocation of M279. Project R832 v12 is the saved capability antecedent, not a new CORE source and not an executable authorization. No bound proposition defines caprmedio-specific expansion rules/constraints/defaults; therefore this family supplies no new `003_PROJECT_CONFIGURATION` Atom. If a later authorized task defines such project-specific rules, R1207 governs that destination; current activation/revisions remain FIS artifacts, never those Atoms.

Actual narrow Delivery gap: O052 v4 has only `# Resolve Project and Framework Settings before derived structure`; it lacks literal `# Summary`, `## Operation` and `## Details` required by current D479 v6. CA-C-353 preserves that issue. Its behavior is readable and semantically reconcilable; this report neither fixes nor silently waives the source-carrier defect. A governed source-authoring follow-up must normalize the carrier without inventing semantic changes, followed by independent review and the parent's RMED/source save gates.

### Required follow-up and assurance ownership

1. Parent P1130 integrates this existing-coverage mapping without marking its other families done. P1131 / P1156 gates remain under root control; this leaf retains its original BLOCKS edges.
2. Source-authoring owner addresses C353 through the governed workflow, preserving O052 semantics/identity and following D479. Independently review S01-S10 and O01-O06 against then-current source revisions; no candidate or historical report is approval.
3. RMED integration references R1052/R1207/R1430/R1750 ownership, M279 resolution technique, E446 assurance and D366/D374 carrier serialization instead of duplicating them. Do not broaden R1712 runtime-fact evidence into a new generic journal-mutation Action.
4. An authorized Implementation leaf later demonstrates E446 v12's two-Project case, per-unit explicit/omitted overrides, missing/invalid parameters, valid false/zero/empty, no Project Atom/Implementation prerequisite, no Projection edits and no cross-Project reads. This task did not inspect or run code and makes no implementation-gap or test-pass claim. Capability alone never initiates these tests or settings mutations.

### Actual local verification

Pre-Done proof PASS at2026-10-04 12:36:26UTC,695seconds from the unchanged first clock: strict unique-key YAML for allthree owned carriers, registered target METHODOLOGY_SOURCES, exact D479/D470 headings, unique ownedIDs, all16 table rows,43unchanged saved-input/current-authority fingerprints and original decomposition/BLOCKS. Initial check found two EOF newlines in the bound Plan; its owned Carrier was normalized with updated_at refreshed and the complete pre-Done proof rerun successfully. Final proof PASS at2026-10-04T12:37:53.044453+00:00,782.044453seconds from the unchanged first clock: allthree strict owned carriers,16table rows,43unchanged fingerprints,six local Plan nodes,acyclic BLOCKS/decomposition graphs, unique IDs and registered target. P1343 is physically Done inside the immediate P1130 done container; Epic1117/P1119/P1130 remain Active. O052 bytes are unchanged and the C353 defect remains actual. No native sessions were read. A completion-receipt patch initially failed to match a substring as a complete line; no file changed, and the exact saved line was recovered for this receipt. Closure persistence at 2026-10-04 12:38:54 +0000 remains within900seconds; no reset or overrun. No broad parent or global verifier is used.

Preparation truth: incorrect guessed R832 CORE path, guessed A1047 filename/Concern-folder lookup and a control-path selector produced actual diagnostic failures. Overbroad saved-JSON displays were truncated; omitted text was not counted as read. Recovered by resolving actual paths and reading only the complete relevant assistant originals with exact saved identities; R832 is Project-local. The corrected fingerprint collector succeeded for43 bound/current files. These recovered diagnostics do not establish a second semantic issue or excuse a clock reset.

### Current saved-input and authority fingerprints

These43 files are the exact read controls, Goal,14Principles, Operation/supporting authorities and saved packets. This ledger contains no native-session read. Current source Atoms, not Applicable Methodology projections, govern.

## TLDR

Reuse O052 v4 and existing settings/structure/Journal authority; do not add an Operation or automatically change settings. C353 records the existing Operation's nonconforming headings for governed source-authoring and independent review. Reconciliation only: no harvest, migration, implementation, runtime or broader Epic completion is claimed.
