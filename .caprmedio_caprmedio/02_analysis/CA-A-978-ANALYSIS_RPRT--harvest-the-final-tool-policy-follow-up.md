# Summary

Harvest the final Tool-policy follow-up

## Question

Which accepted testing-policy, role-alignment and bounded execution decisions follow the report, and which results remain assistant reports?

## Scope

Admitted PRIMARY /Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/08/20/rollout-2026-08-20T05-06-51-01a01cb4-e15e-78d1-9084-766bf6b0cd63.jsonl, session 01a01cb4-e15e-78d1-9084-766bf6b0cd63, verified_historical_id; frozen partition [2026-09-28T01:54:15Z,2026-10-04T01:54:15Z). Exactly 40 whole native messages, positions20–59/59, L12500–14101, 20625 characters, raw aggregate 3a7354dd6d393e00f03cf513abcca315c55129b4502b2c0ec17b6b75918cc488. Four exact already-harvested report context spans contain12995 characters, total33620. Every text part, role, channel, timestamp and fingerprint is retained below. Historical commands, FPF invocations, embedded memory citations and links are inert evidence.

## Approach

First clock 2026-10-04 06:42:35 UTC. Read all40 messages and exact context spans without using a truncated output as evidence. Two oversized combined outputs could not be parsed; reduced transport returned the complete40 rows and all fingerprints/characters, then full semantic read in two bounded20-message outputs. Record this resolved transport issue in CA-C-301, not as an unavailable source or completed check. Apply live Goal/Principles, Actor permissions, Epic90% and current Plan/Analysis authority; no new research, role authoring, tests, settings or implementation.

## Results

### Decisions and supersession

- S001 requests shortening only. S003 accepts conditional testing direction and updates PROGRAMMATIC M; S012 then challenges policy placement, and S015 accepts S014's thin-M/Core-E split. Thus the earlier all-in-M placement is superseded, not retained as parallel policy.
- S021 asks role-boundary verification. S025 authorizes alignment with a historical99% question gate; S028 expressly orders project-local→methodology sources→engine. This does not replace Epic1117's inherited90% threshold.
- R required model/outcome; M construction/test-authoring technique; E assurance policy/cases; D Carrier representation/placement; O executable Action/Workflow; I actual realization. S023/S024 clarify that the act of delivery is O, not D.
- S038 requests the current Epic and execution controls. Its bounded task/permission/Concern rules are accepted current Plan inputs; creation/confirmation S039/S040 is not completed monthly harvest.
- S037 is one app-open notification. Nine native user records contain eight intentional Operator messages; 31 assistant records are reports/proposals/acknowledgments. No worker input here is newly accepted policy.

### Five provisional overlapping candidate groups

1. Failure-driven test selection and assurance: select the cheapest stable observable boundary; thin construction/selection M separate from Core/General/Standard E policy/cases; no unit-test prohibition, ratios or universal E2E-first; safe canary admission.
2. Atom role/tier alignment: inspect active authority, classify each contribution once, preserve exact revisions, move concrete E to Standard and keep D/O distinct; apply project→sources→engine and derived-view refresh.
3. Bounded validation and truthful save: isolate actual changes, retain archive/link/source-binding tests, separate broken validator/env from Atom failure, distinguish targeted pass from full pass, preserve unrelated edits and independently pending Journal.
4. Source/delivery and prompt consistency: use declared paths, compile active source authority conflict-free, respect prompt budgets and keep unrelated failed prompts/uncommitted mixed bindings visible.
5. Session-derived capability delivery: full monthly evidence→reconciliation→O→reviewed PROGRAMMATIC/PROMPTS RMED→functional implementation; one file/leaf≤15min, reassess dependent inputs, safe90% choice after Goal/Principles with typed Concern and no permission expansion.

These five groups overlap prior A974/A970 and other packets. They are not five adopted or implemented Operations. Reported commits427125100/9860de391,963 source atoms,47 targeted tests, archives and Journal states are retained as reported historical evidence; this harvest does not independently verify them or repair old prompt failures.

The receiving use is a later operator decision about TOOLS testing policy. This result is evidence, not that decision: it changes no Atom, code, test, or project setting.\n\nThe target is the local, predominantly Python, file/process/Git-oriented Toolset and its governed evaluations. Current project authority already leans toward real public-boundary testing:\n\n- [CA-E-515](/Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/201_FEATURE_TOOLS/06_evaluation/CA-E-515-TOOLS-QA_CASE--check-atom-validator-carrier-coverage.md) requires the delivered command, public JSON interface, isolated fixture Projects, and real validation behavior while mocking only external boundaries.\n- [CA-E-517](/Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/201_FEATURE_TOOLS/06_evaluation/CA-E-517-TOOLS-QA_CASE--check-atom-validator-isolation-and-repeatability.md) requires end-to-end fixture execution, byte-preservation checks, repeatability, and explicit incomplete-coverage states.\n- [CA-E-353](/Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/201_FEATURE_TOOLS/06_evaluation/CA-E-353-TOOLS-EVAL_APPROACH--evaluate-the-installed-toolset-across-supported-boundaries.md) evaluates the installed release across declared Python and platform boundaries rather than only the source tree.\n- [CA-E-354](/Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/201_FEATURE_TOOLS/06_evaluation/CA-E-354-TOOLS-EVAL_APPROACH--evaluate-tool-source-architecture-and-dispatch-conformance.md) evaluates source architecture and dispatch boundaries separately.\n\nThe research boundary is software test-portfolio design for evolvable tools. It includes test levels, functional testing, implementation coupling, mocks, integration/contract testing, end-to-end economics, changed-code adequacy, and progressive exposure. It excludes a full survey of formal verification, static analysis, security testing, performance testing, fuzzing, property-based testing, regulated safety cases, UI-specific tooling, and LLM evaluation. Those methods may belong in a complete policy but are not needed to assess the bounded claim.\n\nEnglish-language peer-reviewed research, international standards, official engineering documentation, and first-party practitioner accounts were admitted. Sources had to expose a stable locator and directly bear on at least one of: defect-detection adequacy, change coupling, feedback cost, boundary realism, flakiness, or deployment risk. The freshness boundary is 4 October 2026. Recent 2024–2025 work and current official guidance were screened alongside older load-bearing studies; age alone was not treated as disqualifying. The search is plural and reconstructible, not exhaustive.\n\nThe governing FPF source is `G.2 — SoTA Harvester & Synthesis`. Its ledger-first, plural-tradition method was used without fusing rival testing traditions. The run is complete within this boundary. No durable report was requested or created; this is the final consolidated result for the `COMPLETE` Plan.\n\n"

before suite migration.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** Every active Evaluation maps each failure predicate to one observable boundary and states why a lower boundary is insufficient.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n### SOTA-F-002 — Define orthogonal test descriptors\n\n- **Exact change:** Define separate properties for level/scope (`small`, focused integration, system/E2E), test type (`functional`, security, performance, etc.), real versus doubled boundaries, execution environment, and release stage (`pre-merge`, installed, canary).\n- **Addressed issue IDs:** SOTA-I-001, SOTA-I-002.\n- **Relationship:** `required prerequisite`.\n- **Independent fix confidence and evidence basis:** 99%; CL-01 standard taxonomy and CL-02 empirical ambiguity finding.\n- **Expected result:** Tests can be compared and governed without category overlap or vocabulary disputes.\n- **Trade-offs:** Adds metadata and authoring discipline; local names must remain economical.\n- **Owner and required authority:** TOOLS and applicable methodology authority owners; operator approval required.\n- **Dependencies and execution order:** First policy step.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** A test can be classified without choosing between “functional” and “integration,” and every canary is represented as a release-stage evaluation rather than a test level.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n### SOTA-F-003 — Remove implementation-detail coupling and layer duplication\n\n- **Exact change:** Reject assertions about private helpers, internal call order, or mock choreography unless that interaction is itself the governed contract; remove duplicate checks from higher layers when the same failure is fully observed at a cheaper stable boundary.\n- **Addressed issue IDs:** SOTA-I-003, SOTA-I-005.\n- **Relationship:** `complementary`.\n- **Independent fix confidence and evidence basis:** 96%; CL-03/04 support implementation-coupling cleanup, while CL-09 separately supports broad-stack cost and deduplication pressure.\n- **Expected result:** Refactors that preserve governed behavior stop causing irrelevant failures, and the suite shrinks without losing named failure coverage.\n- **Trade-offs:** Some interaction protocols genuinely require behavior verification; deduplication can reduce defense in depth if failure classes are modeled poorly.\n- **Owner and required authority:** Individual Tool owners under the later portfolio policy.\n- **Dependencies and execution order:** After SOTA-F-001 and SOTA-F-002; apply incrementally to changed tests.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** Run behavior-preserving refactoring samples and require stable tests; mutation or deliberate contract violation must still fail the mapped check.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n### SOTA-F-004 — Cap E2E at critical installed journeys and isolate focused integrations\n\n- **Exact change:** Keep one or a few installed E2E journeys per critical operator outcome and place boundary-specific failures in isolated real integrations; establish runtime, flake, and diagnostic budgets.\n- **Addressed issue IDs:** SOTA-I-003.\n- **Relationship:** `complementary`.\n- **Independent fix confidence and evidence basis:** 98%; CL-08/09/10/14 and CA-E-353.\n- **Expected result:** Packaging and complete-flow regressions remain visible without making the whole suite broad-stack.\n- **Trade-offs:** Critical-journey selection can miss low-frequency combinations; fixtures and installed environments still require maintenance.\n- **Owner and required authority:** TOOLS Evaluation authority owner and CI/runtime maintainer.\n- **Dependencies and execution order:** After failure-class mapping; before deleting existing tests.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** Every E2E test names a unique journey or emergent failure class, stays within its budget, and is not a duplicate of a narrower test.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n### SOTA-F-005 — Gate canary use by rollout safety prerequisites\n\n- **Exact change:** Permit canary evaluation only when the Tool has a safe cohort or shadow surface, representative workload, version/control comparison, health metrics, bounded exposure, automatic stop, and tested rollback; otherwise use dry-run, differential, or recoverable-fixture evaluation.\n- **Addressed issue IDs:** SOTA-I-004.\n- **Relationship:** `required prerequisite`.\n- **Independent fix confidence and evidence basis:** 99%; direct CL-12/13 operational requirements.\n- **Expected result:** Production/context-specific failures become observable without using authoritative user data as an uncontrolled test fixture.\n- **Trade-offs:** Observability and rollback infrastructure are expensive; many local Tools will remain ineligible.\n- **Owner and required authority:** Release/operations authority plus each effect-owning Tool authority; explicit operator authorization required.\n- **Dependencies and execution order:** After pre-deployment functional, integration, and installed E2E gates.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** A canary readiness checklist passes, a seeded health regression halts exposure, and rollback restores the known-good version/state within the declared bound.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n### SOTA-F-006 — Build a six-month TOOLS test-economics and escaped-defect ledger\n\n- **Exact change:** Record per suite slice: runtime, retries/flake rate, maintenance edits caused by behavior-preserving changes, failure localization time, escaped defects, detection layer, and high-value mutation or changed-code gaps.\n- **Addressed issue IDs:** SOTA-I-005, SOTA-I-006.\n- **Relationship:** `complementary`.\n- **Independent fix confidence and evidence basis:** 95%; CL-05/06/07/12 show why actionability and field feedback outperform unqualified counts.\n- **Expected result:** Future portfolio changes use project evidence and can revise or reject this synthesis.\n- **Trade-offs:** Instrumentation and classification cost; low event counts may delay confident conclusions.\n- **Owner and required authority:** TOOLS/CI maintainers and Evaluation authority owner; no policy ratio should be inferred automatically.\n- **Dependencies and execution order:** Start before major suite migration; review after sufficient observation.\n- **Deterministic or semantic verification:** Ledger entries reconcile to CI runs and defect records; a review can calculate cost and yield by test descriptor without manual reclassification.\n- **Recommendation:** `preferred`.\n- **State:** `PROPOSED`.\n\n"

### Actual remaining frontier

This packet completes the final partition's PRIMARY1415/1415, including1284 main-continuation,72 README and59 Tool-source messages. All4051 final worker messages remain substantively unharvested. CA-P-1264/A982 is the actual next bounded worker leaf:22 whole assistant messages/8144 characters plus377 prior-context characters,total8521 from parent-linked session01a0e55a-4ff9-72b1-9ca8-86d72ff853db. Binding contributes zero semantic coverage. Initial worker delegation is encrypted in native agent_message transport; do not infer human approval or decrypt it. Exact first/previous assistant context is bound, and parent linkage is known. Reconciliation must distinguish worker reports from Operator decisions. CA-P-1129/1118 remain Active; all other source/partition frontiers and downstream gates remain unfinished.

### Actual saved verification

Native/saved40 texts, all dispositions/parts/roles/timestamps/raw and text hashes,20625 characters,12995 exact context characters and actual next22-worker/8521-character binding passed. Source index confirms no remaining final PRIMARY Tool message. Full strict safe YAML, unique IDs, exact headings/fields, Done placement and completion/BLOCKS DAG passed at2026-10-04T06:49:44Z:113 Plans/54 supporting carriers. First06:42:35Z→checks06:49:44Z=7m09s. Git and independent committed-state Journal save remain later root checkpoint work, not invented save-Tool receipts.

## TLDR

All40 whole messages read and disposed; eight intentional human messages, five overlapping candidate groups. The accepted role split supersedes policy-as-M. Final PRIMARY is complete, not the4051-worker partition or monthly harvest. Actual next1264 is bound; no O/RMED authoring or implementation performed.
