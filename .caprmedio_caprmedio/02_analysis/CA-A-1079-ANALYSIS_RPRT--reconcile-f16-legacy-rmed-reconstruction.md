# Summary

Reconcile F16 legacy RMED reconstruction

## Question

Which parts of saved A933 W2 are already governed by current source Operations, and what minimal legacy-extraction gap remains without converting observations or historical reports into accepted RMED?

## Scope

Exactly A1063 v1 source_entry_assignments R0119: primary F16, cross-tags F12/F10, S026, entry 2, W2. A1063's F16 row declares one primary entry from A933; cross-tags do not add entries or close those other families. Candidate input is A933 v1 W2 and its saved H07/EV03 qualifiers, before the raw-record section. No native session file was opened, no new harvest coverage is claimed and no historical command was executed. An initial locator over A933 accidentally exposed raw embedded-record excerpts; they are excluded from this comparison and the actual read-boundary failure is retained in C362, not disguised as a pristine candidate-only read.

Current Goal v13, fourteen active Project Principles, P034 v6, R004 v18/R1799 v1 and Epic P1117 v2 / P1119 v2 / P1130 v5 govern. Saved gates detected P1130's changes v3→v4→v5; both full changed carriers were reread. The v5 historical-support clarification does not change this exact family, authorize new candidates or adopt historical reports. P1361 binds exact paths/revisions; source Operations fully read are O016 v11, O017 v6, O010 v7, O006 v6, O007 v6, O008 v11 and O019 v4. Authoritative source prefix S is `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/`; these are source carriers, not the applicable-methodology projection.

## Approach

The Plan was persisted before substantive comparison. Compare each W2 constituent with its current Operation's actual domain; do not relabel conflict correction as initial specification extraction or implementation preparation as reverse engineering. Existing-source clauses remain reusable within their domain. Gap means retained for independent review and possible separately authorized authoring, not an adopted Claim or implementation commitment.

A933 H07 preserves historical human confirmation of a legacy→RMED→refactoring use case and a scoped request to update drafts. Its proposed→accepted distinction, conditional inputs, behavior-versus-decisions and evidence stages are assistant interpretations retained as provisional candidates. EV03 reports three revised and two new Draft proposals; validation/history claims are not current source or execution proof. Neither historical continuation nor this reconciliation adopts mandatory graph faces or every old design detail.

## Results

### Complete constituent disposition

| ID | Saved W2 / H07 / EV03 constituent | Exact current coverage or limitation | Disposition / canonical destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LR01 | Bind the legacy source and evidence window before extraction. | O017 “Inputs and authority preparation” binds a bounded request, declared universe, candidate evidence, permissions and concrete boundaries; O010 select/propose/correct Steps bind an exact source frontier. These supply reusable admission mechanics, not the missing extraction behavior. | Covered admission mechanism. Reuse CORE O017/O010 where their declared domain fits; bind concrete legacy paths/window in the selected Plan or PROJECT_CONFIGURATION adapter, not generic Operation text. |
| LR02 | Extract graph/evidence with declared, inferred, pre-runtime and runtime provenance. | None of the seven bound Operations defines extraction of legacy implementation objects/relations or typed observation provenance. O010 handles selected source conflicts; O017 prepares implementation from admitted authority. | Gap G1. One reusable CORE legacy-evidence extraction/preparation Action, subject to review; graph generation is a possible delivery technique, not a separate adopted Workflow. |
| LR03 | Accept absent initial RMED/Journal as a legacy intake condition without fabrication. | O017 requires complete governing inputs before implementation; O007/O008 require actual decision/execution recording in their correction domain. They do not admit initial evidence reconstruction from missing normative sources. | Gap G1 intake/result contract. CORE; report absent evidence explicitly. This does not waive applicable current Journal obligations or permit code work with missing governing RMED. |
| LR04 | Distinguish observed behavior from decisions to preserve, change or leave unknown. | O019 realizes selected Requirements and cannot change governing Atoms to obtain a pass; O006 distinguishes intended correction/uncertainty and returns a proposal. Neither defines observation-to-proposed-RMED classification when initial authority is missing. | Gap G1. CORE evidence-to-candidate classification; observed behavior is never automatically a Requirement. |
| LR05 | Produce reviewable provisional RMED before refactoring. | O006 prepares exact corrections for an identified conflict in a selected source frontier; it does not define first-time RMED extraction. O017 consumes selected active R/D, separate E and a complete M input projection. | Gap G1 output/handoff. CORE prepares a source-traceable candidate plus missing/unknown bindings; current source-authoring authority must admit resulting Atoms separately. No proposed RMED is activated by extraction. |
| LR06 | Obtain scoped acceptance; only then rely on resulting authority. | O007 1–4 distinguishes exact approval/rejection/revision/absence and rechecks applicability; O008 1–2 revalidates authorization and writes only to the owning source. O010 decide/correct/reassess reuses these mechanisms for conflicts. | Covered decision/authorized-correction boundary within that domain. Reuse CORE O007/O008; G1 must hand off to the applicable governed authoring route, not silently broaden conflict-correction Actions to every initial Atom creation. |
| LR07 | Refactor against accepted authority and evaluate the result. | O016 supplies test-first transitions, actual terminal conditions and retained blockers/retry accounting. O017 gathers governing R/D, separate E and M inputs; O019 requires prepared tests/baselines, selected ready work and pending-check reporting. M261 v5 requires rebuildability from governing RMED without dependence on the old implementation. | Covered downstream implementation. Reuse CORE O016/O017/O019, not a duplicate refactoring Workflow. After extraction/acceptance, remaining missing authority still blocks this implementation admission. |
| LR08 | Graph remains a non-authoritative Projection, not a new governing source. | O017 explicitly distinguishes its derived Method Projection from Method authority; O006 5/O008 2 reject projected-copy correction targets; P1117 explicitly requires source destinations, never projection authoring. | Covered authority boundary; reject any inference that an extracted graph or proposed spec gains governing authority merely from being produced. G1 preserves source/decision traceability and this separation. |
| LR09 | Missing face/value/generation contracts remain explicit; mandatory two faces stays open. | W2 and EV03 explicitly retain these as unresolved design particulars. M005 v8 admits mechanisms only when needed for required outcomes/distinctions; no current source adoption was established by this packet. | Non-operational/deferred design particulars. Later applicable graph RMED review may justify them; no face count, value schema or generator is adopted or required to close this reconciliation. |
| LR10 | Historical draft edits, validation/history reports or use-case confirmation establish an implemented facility. | H07/EV03 explicitly distinguish desired use case, assistant proposals and reported Draft work from present implementation. O019 returning implemented is itself not passing-Evaluation proof; E001 requires checkable results. | Rejected interpretation. Preserve historical evidence qualifiers; no live adoption, active facility, validation pass or runtime execution is inferred. |
| LR11 | Treat conditional legacy intake as permission to skip RMED acceptance, tests or current Journal evidence during refactoring. | O017 blocks incomplete/conflicting authority and unmet permissions/prerequisites; O016 blocks unmet gates and stale/unevaluated obligations; O008 records actual correction effects. R1799/P034 prohibit unadmitted execution. | Rejected interpretation. Legacy discovery precedes authority-ready implementation; it does not weaken downstream gates or authorize effects. |
| LR12 | Carry exact caprmedio graph/Draft IDs, historical packet paths or campaign details into the reusable Operation. | Those are historical project inputs, not the project-independent observation/decision boundary. M002 v15 requires canonical reuse; the Epic distinguishes CORE from PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destinations. | Non-operational project particulars for this CORE family. Retain only as evidence; any still-needed caprmedio-specific adapter must be separately bound in PROJECT_CONFIGURATION. |

Twelve constituents are dispositioned: four covered, four gap rows composing one G1, two rejected interpretations and two non-operational/deferred particulars. This closes only R0119/W2, not F12/F10 or all other reconciliation families.

### Minimal gap, destination and follow-up

Retain one G1 candidate: prepare legacy implementation evidence and a provisional RMED reconstruction packet. Inputs bind the legacy source/window, permitted observation methods, existing authority when available and explicit absence/unknowns. Outputs distinguish observed/declared/inferred evidence, preserve/change/unknown candidate decisions, proposed R/M/E/D and source references, missing contracts, and a ready-for-review or blocked handoff. It neither activates Claims nor executes refactoring. Reuse source-decision/authorization mechanisms and O016 downstream; do not create another complete implementation Workflow, approval Atom, Journal or canonical graph authority.

Reusable destination, if independently accepted: `S` (CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations). No exact new Operation ID/carrier is allocated here; review must first confirm whether one new preparation Action or a narrowly justified existing-Action amendment is the minimum owner. Caprmedio-specific legacy paths, graph adapter/storage and concrete source selection belong to `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/003_PROJECT_CONFIGURATION/` only if separately required and authorized. Neither destination is a projection.

Root's next bounded work is independent review of G1 against the reconciled families and relevant source authority, then one bound source-authoring leaf if retained. RMED stages must separately specify the candidate packet/provenance, conditional inputs, missing/blocked result, review/acceptance boundary and graph delivery only where justified. Later implementation/runtime verification should start with an isolated legacy fixture with deliberately absent initial RMED/Journal: extraction returns provisional, traceable observations and explicit unknowns without fabricating authority or history; a separately authorized acceptance binds the resulting sources before O016 refactoring. Functional reconstruction must then demonstrate the accepted behavior from governing RMED without relying on the old implementation. No fixture, build, service or runtime verification was executed here.

P1130 remains Active. This leaf keeps explicit BLOCKS to P1131 and P1156; Root must integrate this disposition and keep other required reconciliation/review gates. A completed leaf does not close authoring, RMED, implementation or Docker stages.

### Saved verification receipt

Two attempts of the saved-carrier/completeness/current-authority/local-DAG gate exited 1 on stale expected P1130 revisions as normal root amendments changed v3→v4→v5. These are retained check outcomes, not new semantic/execution failures or additional Problems; each full changed Plan was reread and its binding refreshed.

The retry returned PASS / exit 0 at 2026-10-04 13:12:12 UTC: strict YAML, registered headings, three unique owned carriers, twelve constituent dispositions, one EOF newline, thirteen current source Operation/Plan-control revisions, fourteen Principle carriers, P1130 v5, exact sequence/decomposition/BLOCKS and six-node local DAG. This is comparison/carrier completeness proof, not runtime verification or independent semantic acceptance.

First actual clock remains 2026-10-04 12:56:53 UTC. Gate elapsed 15m19s; closure write 2026-10-04 13:13:47 UTC, elapsed 16m54s. The <=15-minute estimate was overrun; C362 retains the actual intake scope failure and timing. No remaining constituent is unprocessed and no clock reset, invented success or implementation claim is made. P1361 is Done only for this bounded family; its physical placement is done/ under D461, while P1130 and its other stage gates remain Active.

## TLDR

Reuse O016/O017/O019 for authority-ready refactoring and O010/O006/O007/O008 for their source-conflict decision/correction domain. Retain one minimal CORE legacy-evidence→provisional-RMED preparation gap for independent review. Observations, draft reports and generated graphs are not accepted authority or runtime proof.
