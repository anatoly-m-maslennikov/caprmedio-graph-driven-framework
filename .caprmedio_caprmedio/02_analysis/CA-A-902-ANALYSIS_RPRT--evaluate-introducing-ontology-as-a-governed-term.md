# Evaluate introducing Ontology as a governed CAPRMEDIO term

## Task, scope, and boundaries

**Bottom line:** no material net profit is currently demonstrated for introducing `Ontology` as a CAPRMEDIO Governed Term. The word can remain a General Term or explanatory shorthand, but the live authority already states the operative distinctions more precisely through Core Meta-Model, Term, Entity, graph-kind, Claim, Scope, and authority-stratum concepts. A governed umbrella term would presently add more ambiguity and maintenance than capability.

This is a bounded design challenge, not an adoption decision. The Entity of Concern is the proposed durable `Ontology` term and the effects of admitting it into CAPRMEDIO authority. The intended result is a benefit/cost judgment and an adoption threshold for the CAPRMEDIO owner/operator. This report persists the validated challenge result as one Analysis Atom; it does not introduce an Ontology definition or change any normative model, graph, projection, or project authority.

“Profit” means incremental action-facing value after semantic, governance, validation, documentation, projection, and maintenance costs. Familiarity or shorter wording alone does not count as sufficient profit.

The inspected current-state boundary is the live dirty worktree on branch `amm/next-version`, anchored at valid commit `2f3708e01d55adbd1cbed6108eca54bdeaab4dcb`. Source authority was separated from non-authoritative projections and Analysis/Plan history. A bounded exact search for `Ontology`, `ontology`, `Ontological`, and `ontological` across active Core Meta-Model sources and active project requirement/method/evaluation/delivery carriers returned zero matches. The prior validated structure recovery is used only as the baseline that `Ontology` is not currently a Governed Term and that the nearest explanatory meaning is the applicable model authority plus its active project instances.

Challenge-campaign handoff:

- Campaign ID: `FPF-CAMPAIGN-f55888ed-ef0b-4496-8548-e45ef6658e6e`.
- Phase: one full challenge completed for a new proposal; owner disposition remains outside this result.
- Semantic frontier: introducing `Ontology` as a CAPRMEDIO Governed Term; no meaning or carrier changed.
- Carrier frontier: live authoritative sources at the stated Git anchor plus dirty working-tree state; projections used only as bounded context.
- Evaluation profile: receiving uses, incremental benefit, semantic overlap, ambiguity and category-error risk, lifecycle cost, Framework-versus-Project Configuration placement, and minimum admission threshold. Implementation and external research are excluded.
- Predecessors: the validated one-step Plan and the prior validated ontology structure-recovery result.
- Stop rule: stop after this one full challenge; do not repeat it unless the proposal's meaning, receiving use, authority placement, or evidence frontier materially changes.

## Issues, weak points, and improvements

### Native result

#### Proposal, resolved FPF source, and decision boundary

The proposal is to make `Ontology` a CAPRMEDIO Governed Term. `E.11.PUA` routes the work to the smallest useful decision result. `A.7.1` requires a defeated consequence before durable ontology work. `A.11` requires composition failure, non-redundancy, action-facing contribution, and a sharp boundary. `E.24.CD` warns that a broad recurring word can create a shadow ontology when existing patterns already close the case. `F.18` treats a name as a handle rather than as evidence that a new ontic category exists.

The decision boundary is therefore narrow: this challenge may say whether the evidence establishes incremental profit, propose admission gates, and identify a suitable first authority stratum. It does not define `Ontology`, admit it, or make the CAPRMEDIO owner's decision.

#### FPF Challenge Findings ordered by consequence

1. **Concern — the umbrella meaning is not sharply bounded.** In ordinary use, `ontology` could refer to the Core Meta-Model, the full Applicable Methodology, the Terms Graph, the Entities Graph, a graph projection, project facts, or the whole CAPRMEDIO knowledge system. CAPRMEDIO already distinguishes a Terms Graph as Terms plus admitted Relations and an Entities Graph as Entities plus admitted Relations ([CA-R-1335](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1335-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-terms-graph.md:19>), [CA-R-1438](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1438-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-entities-graph.md:19>)). A graph materialization cannot establish Entity identity ([CA-R-1406](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1406-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--keep-entity-identity-independent-of-graph-materialization.md:20>)). One loose umbrella risks collapsing model, instance, authority, and projection into one category.

2. **Concern — no current receiving use needs the term.** The live Graph App already requires governed graph views, filters, lineage, diagnostics, and current Atom access without treating a projection as authority ([CA-R-1076](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/302_FEATURE_APPS/GRAPH_APP/04_requirement/CA-R-1076-GRAPH_APP-REQUIREMENT--render-interconnected-html-graph-views.md:14>)). The Codex Plugin already exposes the Graph App and routes governed work using existing component names ([CA-R-1073](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/302_FEATURE_APPS/AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS/CODEX_PLUGIN/04_requirement/CA-R-1073-CODEX_PLUGIN-CORE-REQUIREMENT--use-the-smallest-sufficient-codex-plugin-composition.md:9>)); its QA case checks current, stale, and unavailable graph states without an ontology abstraction ([CA-E-316](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/302_FEATURE_APPS/AGENT_HOST_PLUGINS/CODEX_PLUGIN/06_evaluation/CA-E-316-CODEX_PLUGIN-QA_CASE--verify-expose-the-current-graph-app-through-codex.md:18>)). A second bounded search found no active OWL, RDF, SKOS, or external-ontology contract. The proposed term therefore changes no current query, validation, permitted action, integration, or stop condition.

3. **Concern — Core placement would be a category and authority error on present evidence.** The Core Meta-Model admits a durable construct only when the existing model cannot preserve a required operational distinction ([CA-R-151](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-151-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--admit-only-necessary-metamodel-constructs.md:20>)). Core authority owns reusable, implementation-neutral invariants, while mechanism-specific claims belong to the scope that owns the mechanism ([META-REQU-106](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CAPRMEDIO-META-REQU-106-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--keep-the-core-meta-model-implementation-neutral.md:18>)). If a future use is specific to the `caprmedio` Project, Project Configuration is the available bounded expansion authority ([CA-R-1218](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1218-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-project-configuration.md:20>)); core, Extension, and project-specific authority must remain distinct ([CAPRMEDIO-REQU-686](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_caprmedio/04_requirement/CAPRMEDIO-REQU-686-CORE-REQUIREMENT--separate-core-extension-and-project-configuration-authority.md:24>)).

4. **Concern — admission creates real lifecycle cost.** A CAPRMEDIO Term must preserve one Project-specific meaning across all uses, and a Governed Term must be owned by exactly one active Definition Atom ([CA-R-1318](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1318-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-term.md:16>), [CA-R-1319](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-1319-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-governed-term.md:18>), [CA-R-126](</Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework/.caprmedio_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/04_requirement/CA-R-126-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--give-each-governed-term-one-definition-atom.md:19>)). That implies definition, scope, relation, validator, documentation, projection, migration, and future-change obligations. The prior recovery also found stale compiled/direct projections relative to current sources, which makes introducing another governed meaning unsafe until currentness is restored.

5. **FPF not decisive — potential future benefits are real but conditional.** A stable umbrella handle could reduce explanation cost, give the Graph App or Codex Plugin a user-facing entry concept, or anchor a declared external interoperability mapping. None of those uses is currently an authoritative requirement. They become evidence only when a named consumer, output, owner, and failed existing formulation are supplied.

**Benefit/cost judgment:** current expected benefit is mostly lexical convenience; current cost includes ambiguity, possible authority leakage, and a permanent governance surface. Net profit is therefore not established. The evidence supports continuing with precise existing CAPRMEDIO terms and ordinary-English `ontology` when explanatory shorthand is useful.

**Minimum adoption threshold — all gates must pass:**

1. **Named receiving use:** identify a current, recurring consumer and owner, such as a specified query contract, validator, external mapping, UI operation, or decision that needs the term.
2. **Composition-failure proof:** show a concrete case where existing CAPRMEDIO constructs and the explicit phrase “applicable model authority plus active project instances” lose a material distinction. Naming convenience alone fails.
3. **Action-facing difference:** demonstrate at least one claim, query, validation, permission, comparison, repair, or stop condition whose result changes when the proposed definition is present.
4. **Sharp inclusion/exclusion boundary:** provide a one-sentence test that distinguishes `Ontology` from Core Meta-Model, Applicable Methodology, Terms Graph, Entities Graph, Graph of Graphs, any Projection, and the Project as a whole.
5. **Single authority stratum:** use Project Configuration when the meaning serves only the `caprmedio` Project. Core eligibility additionally requires evidence that the same invariant is reusable beyond one project-specific use and remains implementation neutral.
6. **Owned lifecycle:** identify the single Definition Atom, Claim Scope, required relations, validators, documentation, projections, migration effects, accountable owner, and update/removal trigger.
7. **Currentness prerequisite:** restore and verify source-to-projection currentness before publishing or consuming the new governed meaning.

Failure of any gate means `ontology` remains a General Term or explanatory phrase. Passing every gate makes a scoped definition eligible for owner consideration; it does not itself approve adoption.

#### Strengths within inspected scope

- `Ontology` is familiar to knowledge-graph and semantic-modeling audiences, so it can be useful explanatory language.
- A single label could later improve discoverability if one stable operational whole is actually reused by multiple consumers.
- CAPRMEDIO already has the mechanisms needed to govern such a term if it later earns admission: Definition Atom ownership, Claim Scope, Project Configuration, graph kinds, and source/projection separation.
- A Project Configuration trial would keep a future project-specific meaning reversible and prevent premature promotion into reusable Core authority.

#### Unchecked claims and insufficient basis

- No user study, stakeholder vocabulary sample, or measured documentation-comprehension result establishes that the label reduces explanation cost.
- No active interoperability specification requires OWL, RDF, SKOS, or another external ontology contract within the inspected source boundary.
- No impact inventory enumerates every validator, generated view, documentation page, or migration that a new Definition Atom would touch.
- The dirty worktree is a live carrier snapshot, not a published release; concurrent uncommitted work may change the evidence frontier.
- Whether the owner prefers a local explanatory term, a project-scoped governed term, or no use of the word remains an owner decision, but that choice is not required to conclude that current incremental profit is unproven.

#### Return to project authority

The bounded recommendation is to retain `ontology` as ordinary explanatory language and use the existing exact CAPRMEDIO constructs in governed Claims. If a named receiving use later passes all seven gates, the first defensible experiment is a Project Configuration definition scoped to that use. Promotion into the reusable Core Meta-Model should remain ineligible until cross-project reuse and an implementation-neutral invariant are demonstrated. The CAPRMEDIO owner/operator retains the adoption and placement decision.

Campaign result: one full challenge completed; finding states are `concern`, `FPF not decisive`, and `insufficient basis` as recorded above. The permitted next action is owner disposition or provision of a new receiving-use case. A repeated design challenge is not warranted unless that evidence changes.

### Issue registry

#### ONT-PROFIT-001 — No demonstrated action-facing receiving use

- Issue: the proposal currently supplies a name but no governed result that depends on it.
- Evidence: zero bounded active-authority matches for the ontology word family; Graph App and Codex Plugin requirements already express their behavior without the term; no active external-ontology contract was found.
- Consequence: a Governed Term would add authority and maintenance without changing a current operation.
- Affected context: Framework terminology, Graph App, Codex Plugin, documentation, and any future interoperability surface.
- Confidence and basis: `99%`, based on exact live-source searches and the inspected receiving-unit requirements.
- Coverage uncertainty: Analysis/Plan/archive history and external stakeholder preferences were intentionally excluded; absence is bounded to the active authority frontier.
- Lifecycle state: `OPEN`.
- Mapped fixes: `FIX-ONT-001`, `FIX-ONT-002`.

#### ONT-PROFIT-002 — Umbrella meaning creates overlap and category-error risk

- Issue: `Ontology` does not yet distinguish model authority, project instances, named graph kinds, or projections.
- Evidence: separate active definitions exist for Terms Graph, Entities Graph, Governed Term, Project Configuration, and projection-independent Entity identity.
- Consequence: users and tools could treat a derived graph as authority, a project-specific configuration as Core, or an aggregate view as an Entity kind.
- Affected context: Core Meta-Model, project authority, graph projections, tools, UI, and controlled language.
- Confidence and basis: `99%`, based on direct carrier definitions and FPF parsimony/boundary tests.
- Coverage uncertainty: no candidate definition was supplied, so a future sharply bounded definition could defeat this concern.
- Lifecycle state: `OPEN`.
- Mapped fixes: `FIX-ONT-001`, `FIX-ONT-002`, `FIX-ONT-003`.

#### ONT-PROFIT-003 — Reusable Core placement is unsupported

- Issue: the proposal has no evidence of a reusable, implementation-neutral invariant that belongs in Core authority.
- Evidence: CA-R-151 requires material composition failure; META-REQU-106 restricts Core to reusable model invariants; CAPRMEDIO-REQU-686 separates Core, Extension, and Project Configuration authority.
- Consequence: a local convenience label could become framework-wide vocabulary and impose costs on unrelated projects and mechanisms.
- Affected context: Core Meta-Model and all Framework instances.
- Confidence and basis: `99%`, based on direct authority-stratum carriers and absence of a named cross-project use.
- Coverage uncertainty: no independent project or reusable Extension use was presented.
- Lifecycle state: `OPEN`.
- Mapped fixes: `FIX-ONT-002`, `FIX-ONT-003`.

#### ONT-PROFIT-004 — Governance and projection cost is not budgeted

- Issue: Governed Term admission requires single-definition ownership and downstream consistency, while the inherited evidence already identifies source/projection currentness gaps.
- Evidence: CA-R-1318, CA-R-1319, and CA-R-126 impose stable meaning and exactly-one Definition Atom; prior validated recovery records stale compiled/direct projections.
- Consequence: premature admission can propagate different meanings across sources, projections, UI, and documentation.
- Affected context: Definition Atoms, Claim Scope, validators, documentation, compiled methodology, graph projections, Graph App, and plugin views.
- Confidence and basis: `98%`, based on direct lifecycle rules and validated prior currentness findings; the exact implementation effort has not been sized.
- Coverage uncertainty: no dependency-impact report or currentness receipt was produced in this read-only step.
- Lifecycle state: `OPEN`.
- Mapped fixes: `FIX-ONT-002`, `FIX-ONT-004`.

### Fix and improvement register

#### FIX-ONT-001 — Keep `ontology` explanatory and use precise governed terms

- Exact change: in ordinary explanations, allow lowercase `ontology` in its ordinary English sense; in governed Claims, name the exact Core Meta-Model, authority stratum, graph kind, project instances, and projection boundary involved.
- Addressed issues: `ONT-PROFIT-001`, `ONT-PROFIT-002`.
- Relationship: `alternative` to Governed Term admission.
- Independent confidence and basis: `99%`, because General Term is already defined and the existing exact constructs cover inspected uses.
- Expected result: clear communication without a new authority object or category collapse.
- Tradeoffs: explanations remain longer and external audiences do not get one canonical umbrella label.
- Owner/authority: CAPRMEDIO owner for project documentation; existing Core authority remains unchanged.
- Dependencies/order: none.
- Verification: semantic review confirms each use maps to an existing defined construct; deterministic search confirms no new `Ontology` Definition Atom or governed relation was added.
- Recommendation: `preferred`.
- State: `PROPOSED`.

#### FIX-ONT-002 — Require the seven-gate admission threshold

- Exact change: treat the seven gates in the Native result as the minimum evidence package before any `Ontology` Definition Atom is proposed.
- Addressed issues: `ONT-PROFIT-001`, `ONT-PROFIT-002`, `ONT-PROFIT-003`, `ONT-PROFIT-004`.
- Relationship: `required prerequisite` to any future admission path.
- Independent confidence and basis: `98%`, because the gates instantiate current CAPRMEDIO necessity, term ownership, scope, authority-stratum, and projection-currentness rules plus the resolved FPF parsimony tests.
- Expected result: only an action-facing, sharply bounded, owned, and maintainable meaning reaches an authority decision.
- Tradeoffs: raises the evidence burden and delays lexical standardization.
- Owner/authority: CAPRMEDIO owner/operator; the relevant authority owner validates the resulting evidence.
- Dependencies/order: precedes `FIX-ONT-003` and any Core proposal.
- Verification: semantic review of composition failure, boundary, placement, and receiving use; deterministic checks for one Definition Atom, valid relations, validator coverage, and current projection receipts if admission proceeds.
- Recommendation: `preferred`.
- State: `PROPOSED`.

#### FIX-ONT-003 — If earned, trial the term in Project Configuration first

- Exact change: after every admission gate passes for a named project-specific receiving use, propose one scoped Project Configuration Definition Atom without rewriting or aliasing existing Core concepts.
- Addressed issues: `ONT-PROFIT-002`, `ONT-PROFIT-003`, `ONT-PROFIT-004`.
- Relationship: `alternative` to immediate Core admission.
- Independent confidence and basis: `96%` for placement if the use remains project-specific, based on CA-R-1218 and CAPRMEDIO-REQU-686; no claim is made that current evidence passes the gates.
- Expected result: reversible evidence about real use while containing semantic and maintenance consequences to the owning Project.
- Tradeoffs: creates local vocabulary, requires full governance even during a trial, and may never justify promotion.
- Owner/authority: `caprmedio` Project Configuration owner; Core owner remains unaffected.
- Dependencies/order: all `FIX-ONT-002` gates and `FIX-ONT-004` currentness closure must pass first.
- Verification: semantic inclusion/exclusion review; deterministic single-definition, scope, relation, validator, projection, and receiving-use tests.
- Recommendation: `acceptable`.
- State: `PROPOSED`.

#### FIX-ONT-004 — Close projection currentness before any admission

- Exact change: rebuild and validate compiled/direct projections against the complete live authoritative source frontier before any consumer relies on a new governed definition.
- Addressed issues: `ONT-PROFIT-004`.
- Relationship: `required prerequisite` to `FIX-ONT-003` or any Core admission proposal.
- Independent confidence and basis: `100%`, because projections are non-authoritative and the inherited validated recovery identified stale projection evidence.
- Expected result: one traceable active meaning reaches documentation, graph views, and plugin consumers.
- Tradeoffs: requires separate repair and validation work unrelated to the lexical proposal itself.
- Owner/authority: Framework engine/currentness owner and the relevant methodology-source owner.
- Dependencies/order: after authoritative source selection, before governed-term publication or consumption.
- Verification: deterministic source-frontier, revision, digest, and projection-currentness checks plus applicable validators; semantic review confirms no projection became authority.
- Recommendation: `preferred`.
- State: `PROPOSED`.

Immediate Core Meta-Model admission is a reviewed alternative but is **rejected by this challenge on the present evidence**: it fails the demonstrated-reuse, composition-failure, action-facing, and sharp-boundary gates. This is an analytical recommendation, not an owner-recorded rejection state.

## Unresolved evidence gaps

- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-001`: no named current receiving use, consumer, owner, or competency question was supplied.
- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-002`: no failed query, validation, workflow, or decision demonstrates material loss from existing terminology.
- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-003`: no candidate inclusion/exclusion definition exists to test against current Core Meta-Model and graph concepts.
- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-004`: no external ontology-interoperability contract is active in the inspected authority boundary.
- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-005`: exact implementation and maintenance cost is unsized.
- `GAP-ONT-PROFIT-006`: no fresh projection-currentness receipt closes the inherited currentness gap.

These gaps do not block the bounded judgment: they are precisely why present profit is unproven and why admission remains conditional rather than authorized.
