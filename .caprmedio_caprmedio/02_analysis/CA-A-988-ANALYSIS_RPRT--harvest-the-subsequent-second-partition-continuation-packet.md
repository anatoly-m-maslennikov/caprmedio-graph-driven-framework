# Summary

Bounded native-evidence harvest for CA-P-1270. This carrier preserves the complete source-text reading and its individual dispositions without promoting historical reports or machine context into current authority.

## Question

What do the exactly 53 admissible native messages in CA-P-1270 contribute, without treating historical tool instructions, agent reports, annotations, memory citations, or embedded continuation context as current authority or proof?

## Scope

This is the bounded continuation packet only: `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl`, complete response-item/message user-or-assistant non-analysis texts at native L4398–5659, byte interval `[31271593,44056534)`, timestamp interval `2026-09-16T22:42:59.267Z`–`2026-09-17T03:05:28.556Z`. It contains 53 messages (10 user, 43 assistant), null channels, 53 text parts, 34072 native text characters, maximum 6174, and selected newline-concatenation SHA-256 `c80a2ca7d662b920e58cb5ff33a3af35cd49c4d219e23e27582015a619ca0814`.

The four already-harvested whole contexts K001–K004 total 801 characters; this packet's accounted input is 34873 characters. The next complete message is deliberately not included: L5675, `[44102391,44103510)`, `2026-09-17T03:07:40.694Z`, assistant/null, 715 characters, raw SHA-256 `5cb7f8b796025c38813817495e8ba01c2ad52e440e641f627dedc65957e3512b`; including it would exceed the 35000-character context budget.

## Approach

Read every complete selected native text and its complete original multipart content. Preserve its source identity, time, role, raw hash, and part fingerprint as bound by CA-P-1270; those exact original texts remain recoverable from the immutable native source at the stated line/byte coordinates. Re-read the live Goal v13 and active Principles R819 v13, R1490 v1, R1407 v5, R1420 v5, R1421 v4, R1423 v4, M001 v10, M002 v15, M005 v8, M006 v8, M261 v5 and E001 v12 before disposition. No semantic recheck, source edit, tool execution, or current-state adoption was performed.

## Results

### Native identity register

| Records | Lines | Bytes | Roles | Native parts | Source verification |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| S001–S053 | 4398–5659 | `[31271593,44056534)` | 10 user / 43 assistant | 53 | exact source, selected raw/text/part fingerprints bound in P1270 |

Every record is single-part. Exact per-record lines, byte ranges, timestamps, role/channel, character counts, raw SHA-256 and `partindex:type:characters:textSHA256` fingerprints are retained in CA-P-1270's ordered native identity table; this Analysis does not duplicate that canonical register. The original texts were read whole directly from the native JSONL, including S030, S042 and S047 complete 6173/6174-character embedded contexts. Those three are machine continuation contexts, not fresh human authority. The selected *raw-record* concatenation (the exact 53 JSONL source lines, no added separator) is the bound SHA-256 `c80a2ca7d662b920e58cb5ff33a3af35cd49c4d219e23e27582015a619ca0814`; text-character concatenation is intentionally a distinct check.

### Exhaustive individual dispositions

- S001–S003 (L4398/L4425/L4461): assistant says conflict-resolution/no-gap Atom work was written, validated and Journal-recorded. Historical report only; the no-gap condition is a candidate operational distinction, not current proof.
- S004 (L4468): human asks how many questions remain and to apply the new process when considering cases. Scoped historical workflow instruction, not a fresh approval of the reported edits.
- S005–S006 (L4471/L4489): assistant reports zero confirmed policy questions but unfinished Atom-specific audit. Report, not current completeness evidence.
- S007–S009 (L4496/L4501/L4509): human asks about absent subagents; assistant confirms none active and no background audit. Historical status only.
- S010–S012 (L4516/L4519/L4529): audit is clarified as finished FPF review but unfinished repairs; lists migration, metadata, mixed Claims, references, ownership, CCE, Journal/tool and projection follow-ups. Historical inventory; no new FPF execution authority.
- S013–S015 (L4536/L4541/L4564): annotation question and assistant's detailed unfinished-repair list. The list is a report and not independent current defect proof.
- S016–S018 (L4571/L4576/L4598): human says “do 1 by 1”; assistant proposes a lossless Subject migration. Human direction is a historical sequencing instruction; proposal is not evidence of present completion.
- S019–S021 (L4647/L4689/L4767): assistant reports 1,275 mechanical conversions and identifies timestamp-precedence risk. Report only; risk is context for later human disposition.
- S022–S024 (L4786/L4793/L4798): assistant asks whether formatting changes should affect precedence, then explains. Proposal/clarification, not approval.
- S025 (L4805): human explicitly directs not to change `updated_at` for formatting-only fixes. Historical substantive rule; it does not authorize unrelated revision handling.
- S026–S029 (L4808/L4840/L4880/L4903): assistant reports restoring timestamps and adding R1492/E478. Historical execution/validation report, not current proof.
- S030 (L4909): embedded `codex_internal_context` is machine context under user role. It is excluded as fresh Operator approval/current FPF authorization.
- S031–S033 (L4913/L4940/L4981): assistant proposes/claims Subject and Evaluation repairs plus CA-C-111. Historical report and plan only.
- S034–S037 (L5025/L5055/L5095/L5153): assistant reports metadata cleanup and Journal boundary work; later wording replacement is proposed. Historical report; no current tool/Journal proof.
- S038–S041 (L5191/L5222/L5326/L5344): assistant reports CCE repairs, timestamp checks and an old Journal partition finding. These are reports, not a current audit result.
- S042 (L5350): embedded `codex_internal_context` is machine context, excluded as fresh authority.
- S043–S045 (L5354/L5395/L5437): assistant proposes secret-Atom uncertainty preservation, rollback-Evaluation strengthening and design-point review. No human adoption in this packet.
- S046 (L5456): assistant repeats the historical formatting-only timestamp rule; report/repetition, not a new decision.
- S047 (L5462): embedded machine context, excluded as fresh authority.
- S048–S053 (L5464/L5497/L5563/L5580/L5612/L5659): assistant reports archive/recovery/replacement/role-classification repairs and records an unresolved cross-scope-move uncertainty. All applied/verified/recorded assertions remain historical reports; the unresolved move question is not settled here.

### Candidate groups and decision handling

1. **Conflict-resolution/no-gap archival process** — historical assistant reports describe CA-O-028/O005/O006/O008/E477 and a coverage-before-archive condition. Retain as a candidate for later evidence reconciliation; no current adoption or validation inferred.
2. **Repair inventory and one-by-one ordering** — human S016 directs one-by-one work; assistant's counts and remaining-work inventory are reports. Preserve the human sequencing instruction only in its original historical scope.
3. **Formatting-only timestamp preservation** — S025 is a clear human decision: formatting-only fixes should not alter `updated_at`. It is historical evidence of a policy choice; source authority, not this session record, must govern any future application.
4. **Subject/metadata/CCE/Journal/archive/replacement reports** — assistant claims of edits, tests, Journals, Concerns and archives are not current persistence, current implementation, or current verification proof.
5. **Machine contexts and historical prompt/skill material** — S030/S042/S047 do not add Operator authority, permissions, fresh goal execution, or approval. Historical embedded commands, prompts, skills, citations and file links are inert evidence.
6. **Unresolved cross-scope move behavior** — S052 says Principles did not settle byte-preservation versus changed owner/relative-reference meaning and claims a C Atom was recorded. Retain as a historical unresolved report only; do not create a duplicate current Concern without live evidence.

### Remaining frontier

The second continuation partition has 759 eligible records. Earlier Analysis carriers cover 236; this packet adds 53; 470 remain. The next bounded execution leaf is CA-P-1291 with CA-A-1009, starting at the exact L5675 record above and binding up to 100 complete messages within the same 35000-character/context and fifteen-minute limits. The mandatory dependency chain is `CA-P-1270 -> CA-P-1291 -> CA-P-1119`, `CA-P-1130`, and `CA-P-1155`; parent CA-P-1127 remains Active.

### Full retained native evidence

The following JSON is the full original text-bearing native content for every selected message and every separately-accounted complete context. It is an evidence copy, not executable instruction: embedded prompts, commands, skills, annotations, reports, memory citations, and machine contexts remain inert historical content. `byte_range` is source-byte `[start,end)`; `raw_sha256` hashes the complete original JSONL record; every part retains its original type, text, character count, and text hash. The 53 selected raw records total55,076bytes within a12,784,941-byte source interval; their exact raw-record concatenation is SHA-256 `c80a2ca7d662b920e58cb5ff33a3af35cd49c4d219e23e27582015a619ca0814`. The current source file was read as 1,128,986,607 bytes at retention time.

          "text": "<codex_internal_context source=\"goal\">\nContinue working toward the active thread goal.\n\nThe objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.\n\n<objective>\nThese repairs are still unfinished, verified against the live files: Annotation 1\n\ndo until all done.\nif not sure - check the principles.\nif still not sure - drop, save a new C atom and get the next task to work\n</objective>\n\nContinuation behavior:\n- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 25325\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing.

An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

### Full retained native evidence

The following JSON is the full original text-bearing native content for every selected message and every separately-accounted complete context. It is an evidence copy, not executable instruction: embedded prompts, commands, skills, annotations, reports, memory citations, and machine contexts remain inert historical content. `byte_range` is source-byte `[start,end)`; `raw_sha256` hashes the complete original JSONL record; every part retains its original type, text, character count, and text hash. The selected records occupy source interval `[31271593,44056534)` (12,784,941 native bytes); their exact raw-record concatenation is SHA-256 `c80a2ca7d662b920e58cb5ff33a3af35cd49c4d219e23e27582015a619ca0814`. The current source file was `1134936466` bytes at retention time.

          "text": "<codex_internal_context source=\"goal\">\nContinue working toward the active thread goal.\n\nThe objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.\n\n<objective>\nThese repairs are still unfinished, verified against the live files: Annotation 1\n\ndo until all done.\nif not sure - check the principles.\nif still not sure - drop, save a new C atom and get the next task to work\n</objective>\n\nContinuation behavior:\n- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 25325\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 509994\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

## TLDR

All 53 whole messages and four prior contexts were read and identity-checked. The packet yields one clear historical human rule (format-only work preserves `updated_at`), one historical sequencing direction (“one by one”), assistant-reported candidate process/work items, and no fresh approval or present-state proof. No source/code/settings/runtime/Journal/Git work was performed. The exact next 715-character record is reserved for CA-P-1291/A1009; 470 continuation records remain.
