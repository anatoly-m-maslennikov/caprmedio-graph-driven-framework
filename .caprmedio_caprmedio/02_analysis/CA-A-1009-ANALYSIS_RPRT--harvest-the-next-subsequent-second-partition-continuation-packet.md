# Summary

Bounded evidence harvest for the frozen CA-P-1291 selection. All selected source text, native parts, and prior contexts are retained below; no historical report is promoted into current proof.

## Question

What do the 32 frozen complete native messages contribute when their original texts, parts, identity, and historical status are retained without a new semantic recheck?

## Scope

Exactly the P1291 v2 binding: 32 messages / 32777 characters plus five whole contexts / 1891 characters, total 34668. The source is `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl`; selected positions are 290–321. No next packet is executed.

## Approach

Read each whole selected text and part and each complete context. Preserve exact source coordinates, timestamp, role/channel, raw record hash and part fingerprint. Live Goal/Principles govern present work; historical prompts, commands, annotations, machine contexts, and assistant reports are inert unless independently current.

## Results

### Full retained native evidence

The JSON fence is a durable evidence copy. `byte_range` is source `[start,end)`; `raw_sha256` hashes the full JSONL record; each part keeps its original type, full text, character count and text hash. Selected raw-record concatenation SHA-256 is `3246b110093de95af4e0865410c400a491a9c816eb39384e473fc55110387d12`; current source bytes are `1137044265`.

          "text": "<codex_internal_context source=\"goal\">\nContinue working toward the active thread goal.\n\nThe objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.\n\n<objective>\nThese repairs are still unfinished, verified against the live files: Annotation 1\n\ndo until all done.\nif not sure - check the principles.\nif still not sure - drop, save a new C atom and get the next task to work\n</objective>\n\nContinuation behavior:\n- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 686988\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

          "text": "<codex_internal_context source=\"goal\">\nContinue working toward the active thread goal.\n\nThe objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.\n\n<objective>\nThese repairs are still unfinished, verified against the live files: Annotation 1\n\ndo until all done.\nif not sure - check the principles.\nif still not sure - drop, save a new C atom and get the next task to work\n</objective>\n\nContinuation behavior:\n- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 844052\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.\n- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.\n- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.\n\nBudget:\n- Tokens used: 954042\n- Token budget: none\n- Tokens remaining: unbounded\n\nWork from evidence:\nUse the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.\n\nNo-progress check:\n- Classify the previous goal turn as progress, a verified wait, or no progress. Progress changes authoritative state, completes work, or yields evidence that changes the next action; status restatements and unexecuted plans are no progress.\n- A verified wait polls a specific process, session, job, or tool handle confirmed live now. Conversation, intent, prior output, or a lock or state file alone is insufficient. Treat work as stopped only when authoritative state says it is terminal or its handle is missing. An observation timeout or transient polling failure is not terminal: re-poll the same handle or inspect other authoritative state; never restart solely because observation expired.\n- Revalidate a no-progress turn and take the next available safe action. If none exists because the same genuine blocker remains, report it and leave the goal active until the blocked audit threshold is met. Treat equivalent blockers as the same condition across turns even when their wording or stated next step changes.\n\nFidelity:\n- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.\n- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.\n- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.\n\nCompletion audit:\nBefore deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:\n- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.\n- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.\n- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.\n- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.\n- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.\n- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.\n- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.\n- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.\n\nDo not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status \"complete\" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.\n\nBlocked audit:\n- Do not call update_goal with status \"blocked\" the first time a blocker appears.\n- Only use status \"blocked\" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.\n- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked \"blocked\", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status \"blocked\" again.\n- Use status \"blocked\" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.\n- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status \"blocked\".\n- Never use status \"blocked\" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.\n\nDo not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.\n\n</codex_internal_context>"

### Individual dispositions

- S001 (L5675): reports moving archive/update/replacement procedures M→O, stronger authorization/rollback/Summary/timestamp checks, and C-119 cross-Scope uncertainty; execution/Journal claims remain historical reports.

### Candidate groups and frontier

1. **Operational-role separation:** historical reports move archive, update, replacement, creation, read-only, query, mutation, lifecycle, search and upgrade procedures from M/CORE into R/O/E/D roles; reports are not current proof.
2. **Timestamp and identity preservation:** formatting-only changes preserve `updated_at`; historical-ID reuse and independent-Claim replacement IDs are distinct refinements. The human decision is only present through earlier retained context, not renewed here.
3. **Journal/Git and transaction boundaries:** records distinguish Journal recording from staged-Git state, stale Git targets, Finder reads/scheduler writes, and post-effect rollback proof. Tool changes are expressly not claimed.
4. **Projection currentness and decomposition:** accepted rebuild events do not prove currentness; currentness depends on sources/checks. Timestamp, rebuild and provenance requirements are independently changeable.
5. **Open boundaries:** cross-Scope moves (C-119), General-tier upgrade targets, M-087 aggregate/recovery flow, and legacy-ID validator handling remain reported unresolved items, not silently adopted repairs.

### Saved next frontier

The packet contains historical repair/review material only. Preserve any reported adoption, withdrawal, proposal, or completion claim as evidence requiring later current-authority reconciliation; no implementation or current verification is inferred here. P1294/A1012 is reserved as the next bounded continuation leaf; P1127 stays Active and downstream P1119/P1130/P1155 remain blocked.

## TLDR

All 32 whole selected messages, their original parts, and five full contexts are durably retained. Native evidence is read, not expanded into new semantic coverage; historical statements remain historical.
