# Summary

Publish current lifecycle source pins

## Objective

derive and publish the accepted lifecycle source revision through the bounded registered refresh and existing authorized Journal lifecycle.

## Details

- the existing writer refreshes Release admission only; it cannot bind the newly clarified lifecycle Action.
- use the exact source registration instead of hand-editing the derived manifest or weakening its dispatch freshness checks.
- keep **all** sixteen capability identities and graph topology unchanged. root owns actual publication and release integration.

## Definition of Done

the source contract, implementation and negative fixtures are independently accepted; actual publication has exact readback and a real Journal receipt; all sixteen routes rediscover with current bindings.

## Result

the registered eight-occurrence lifecycle refresh is actually published as binding revision 8 and the normal current Release-admission refresh as revision 9. exact readback, preserved historical Journal prefixes and completed receipts are retained at journal:release-manifest:f0b7cea609921392f1059bc218f04d8d8ebf21aa55e1b433b8bfc8d5804f0c00 and journal:release-manifest:7dcde04ace60ee550b67e037978b85176ad90753c1d48147b8ef162d390eb804. twelve source-refresh regressions and independent review pass. live MCP context retrieval passes for all sixteen route names at canonical digest e26598708056b90f9bea85148a02b98bab51a74d66b987f1232ad1cb18eb77aa, without topology changes or Run execution.
