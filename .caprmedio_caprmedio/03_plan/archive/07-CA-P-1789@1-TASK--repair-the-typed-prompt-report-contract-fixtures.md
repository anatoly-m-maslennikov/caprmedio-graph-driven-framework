# Summary

Repair the typed prompt report contract fixtures

## Objective

repair orchestrator and Implementation typed report fixtures without relaxing the accepted release or source-currentness boundaries.

## Details

- this bounded lane feeds a fresh source-bound N10; retain failed N9 without replay.
- root owns Git, integration, source pins, canonical refresh and actual dispatch. workers preserve other lanes' changes.
- local fixture/source acceptance is not full Release acceptance; installed N remains unchanged.

## Definition of Done

2c16f633a; thirty-eight cases pass, retaining baseline failure, source gates and candidate mutation assertions.
