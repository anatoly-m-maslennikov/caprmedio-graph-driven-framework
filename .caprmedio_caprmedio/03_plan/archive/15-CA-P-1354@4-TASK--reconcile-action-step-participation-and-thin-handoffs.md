# Summary

Reconcile Action/Step participation and thin handoffs

## Objective

One assigned AI Agent must reconcile all twelve unrepresented/unassigned F09 primary entries from saved CA-A-1063 with current source authority, save compact CA-A-1072, verify exact saved-entry coverage and current Carrier/dependency readiness, then close only this bounded leaf. Estimate <=15 minutes including binding/preparation, reading, saving and verification; first actual clock 2026-10-04 12:59:56 UTC, never reset. This Plan is saved before candidate-comparison execution. If the complete intent set genuinely exceeds the estimate, retain a bound decomposition/remainder rather than false Done.

### Exact saved inputs and selection

CA-A-1063 v1's JSON `source_entry_assignments` and `source_section_locators` bind exactly these NEEDS_RECONCILIATION F09 entries; Markdown ordinals are one-based, JSON group indices zero-based:

| Register refs | Exact saved section | Entries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R0013/R0014/R0015/R0016; S003 | CA-A-908, `Reusable candidate groups and acceptance boundaries` | Ordinals 1–4: H908-C1–C4 |
| R0022; S004 | CA-A-909, `Reusable candidates and provisional destinations` | Ordinal 5: H909-C5 |
| R0143; S031 | CA-A-941, `Three provisional candidate groups` | Ordinal 2: W2 |
| R0172; S042 | CA-A-958, `Provisional candidate groups` | Ordinal 1: C01 |
| R0182; S044 | CA-A-966, `Provisional capability groups` | Ordinal 3 |
| R0396; S090 | CA-A-1034, JSON fence 0 `provisional_groups` | Index 3: G4 |
| R0429/R0430/R0433; S098 | CA-A-1041, `Provisional overlapping reusable groups and current-adoption limits` | Ordinals 1/2/5 |

Read the full selected entries and their saved acceptance qualifications, not raw/native sessions. Canonical saved paths are `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/` plus each exact Analysis-ID Carrier identified by A1063; historical proposals, reported changes/tests and scoped assent are evidence, not current authority or runtime proof.

### Current authority and output

Live Goal v13, all fourteen active Project Principles, CA-P-1117 v2 / CA-P-1119 v2 / CA-P-1130 v5, current Plan/BLOCKS/Carrier controls and Epic's 90% confidence/latest-Operator-input rule govern. P1130's changed v4 and later v5 were fully reopened before completing this comparison; all 26 prior full-read governing fingerprints remain unchanged. Corpus remains the closed 102 completed packets / 5,463 records; no canceled/partial harvesting is resumed. Compare full intents against Active source Operations under `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/`, excluding archives and generated projections. Fully read matching current Action/Step/Workflow and thin-context flows; source definitions/revisions, not historical names, decide coverage and owner. Read current source CA-R-1520 v5 and saved CA-A-1064 v2; reuse their Workflow handoff contract and accepted optional completed-Plan assessment gap instead of duplicating them. Do not add a new design or FPF stage.

Exact compared Operations: CORE_META_MODEL O016 v11, O017 v6, O020 v5, O079 v4, O091 v4, O092 v3, O094 v4, O098 v4, O104 v9, O105 v5, O106 v8, O108/O109/O110 v6 and PROJECT_CONFIGURATION O114/O115/O116/O117 v1, all in their current source 09_operations containers. Current invocation definitions R1452 v10, R1509 v6, R1510 v4, R1511 v5, R1513 v4, R1519 v5, R1525 v6, R1526/R1527 v4, R1528 v5 and R1789–R1793 v1 constrain interpretation. A1072 identifies exact carrier filenames/clauses; D497 v3 and Tool D514–D517 v1 bind context/observation interfaces. Current WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR R1522 v4 / R1523 v1 / R1524 v2 / D521 v2 and Engine R1607 v1 / Agentic R1600 v1 retain runtime/prompt ownership without claiming implementation proof. Root explicitly confirmed that standalone Agentic Action packaging/result intake remains bounded Engine RMED/runtime follow-up, not another O invocation layer or literal coverage by Step-specific R1789.

Own this Plan, `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1072-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-action-step-participation-and-thin-handoffs.md`, and CA-C-368 only if an actual issue requires a typed Concern. No O/RMED/code/runtime/settings/parent/Git/Journal edits. Preserve others' files. For each complete intent group, record covered/gap/rejected/non-operational disposition, every exact register/saved locator, current source/revision/clause, CORE_META_MODEL or PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination and minimal later runtime scenario; retain non-operational metadata/current-RMED ownership without inventing an Operation. A1064's already-accepted gap is reuse, not a new gap.

### Verification and completion

Reopen the saved compact Analysis; prove the complete selected F09 register set maps exactly once to its full saved entries and explicit intent dispositions. Check strict duplicate-safe YAML, registered Analysis/Plan/conditional Concern headings, unique IDs/navigation 15, one EOF newline, unchanged current comparison inputs, direct P1130 decomposition, retained BLOCKS P1131/P1156 and acyclic local completion DAG. This is saved-evidence/source verification, not runtime execution or Operation adoption. Record failures, actual timing and substantive remainders truthfully. When all bound reconciliation work and this small saved gate pass, move only P1354 Markdown to its immediate parent's done/ under CA-D-461. Parent P1130 stays Active; root alone integrates parents and binds authoring/runtime follow-up. Do not execute any next leaf.

## Details

### Passed comparison and actual terminal closure

All twelve F09 entries have complete-intent dispositions in A1072; no new O gap is accepted, and A1064's existing assessment gap is reused. The small saved gate passed 2026-10-04 13:14:07 UTC, 851 seconds from original 12:59:56: twelve exact refs/seven sections, eighteen current source O revisions/filenames, twenty-six unchanged governing fingerprints, three strict registered owned Carriers, navigation15 and five-Plan acyclic DAG/BLOCKS/current P1130 v5 Active. Full saved Analysis and changed parent v5 were reopened. The stale-v4 gate and later no-write exact-line closure patch failure are retained in resolved C368. Actual terminal closure 2026-10-04 13:18:01 UTC: 1085 seconds from original 2026-10-04 12:59:56 UTC, 185 seconds beyond the estimate, never reset. Root expressly authorized closure of the original leaf after minor terminal-save recovery: no semantic expansion, new bookkeeping leaf or extra semantic recheck. P1354 becomes physically Done only after the passed gate and explicit root recovery authorization. C368 is resolved. Parent/authoring/runtime gates remain in force; root owns actual integration and next binding.

### Definition of Done

CA-A-1072 exists with all twelve exact F09 entry refs and every independent clause dispositioned against fully read current source authority, exact ownership/revision and minimal follow-up; any actual issue has typed C368 or an explicitly reused existing accepted gap. Saved read-back/coverage/Carrier/local dependency gate passes, and actual original clock/terminal timing are retained. Missing full-intent coverage, unresolved authority choice, an unbound substantive remainder, source authoring/runtime claims, or whole-family/whole-stage completion beyond this bound set falsifies Done.
