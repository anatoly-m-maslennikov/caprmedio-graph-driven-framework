# Summary

Deny implementation workspace authority overlap

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, repair selected Implementation workspace admission to reject the selected Project root or an ancestor, authority and Git overlap, and symlink aliases before callback execution. Preserve disjoint disposable workspace admission and trusted selected-root binding.

## Details

This is one independently owned Epic Task. Preserve concurrent edits, use no FPF or harvesting, and ask the Operator below the selected 90% confidence threshold. Root records the Task result and commits related validated changes.

## Saved result

Saved the trusted-root overlap guards in implementation_actions.py and focused selected-project tests. Development-worker focused suites passed 17 tests. P1588 independent review accepted the final bytes and reproduced zero callback calls for the Project root, authority root, and .git. This is source/development-worker evidence, not immutable-image or live-Agent evidence.

## Definition of Done

Exact authority-overlap bypass is closed and independently reviewed; normal disposable workspaces remain admitted.
