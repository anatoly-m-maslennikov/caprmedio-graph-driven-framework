# Summary

Review the final Create and replacement source correction

## Objective

Independently review only P1481's four changed current carriers: O032v5, R865v14, E303v14 and E247v12. Use P1472's previous review and C428/C429. Confirm D450 was replaced by admitted Active D508 without altered numbering meaning, and E247 distinguishes pre-Run denial from actual started rejected/failed Run evidence. Compare E247 with its complete archived v11. Preserve all other accepted behavior.

Own only this Plan; do not edit Sources, run code, harvest, use FPF, append Journal events or commit. Estimate <=8 minutes. Save the exact bounded verdict and any finding, then move this leaf to done/ if review is complete; findings do not constitute source acceptance.

## Details

### Independent result

PASS. The independent workflow_final_source_review Agent read all four current carriers, D508 and archived D450, and complete E247@11. D508/D450 contain the identical next-unreused Project-wide per-Content-Role numbering Claim. No retired D450 reference remains in the four changed current carriers. E247v12 limits unchanged-Journal denial to pre-Run denial and retains actual started rejected/failed Run evidence. Its complete v11 comparison changes only that qualification and admitted lifecycle metadata. No actionable defect, Source edit or runtime claim. This saved root receipt records the review actually returned by the separate reviewer.

### Definition of Done

One independent four-carrier review result is saved with current revisions and comparison evidence. Root owns Concern disposition and source-stage closure.
