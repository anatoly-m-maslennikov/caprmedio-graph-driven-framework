# Summary

Review the Release suite driver integration

## Objective

Independently review the driver, golden corpus and sealed suite integration against their accepted RMED.

## Details

Review only this Release prerequisite, not the deferred final all-sixteen audit. Require real per-testcase IDs, complete discovery, truthful group attestation, immutable inputs and failed/incomplete handling. Source/fixture acceptance does not close the actual Docker Release suite gate. Expected bounded work: <=15 minutes; decompose if needed.

## Definition of Done

The bounded implementation is independently accepted and targeted tests are saved; the actual complete Release gate remains separately identified until executed.

## Results

Independent bounded source/code reviews accept the repaired guard timing, sealed context, exact report admission and golden fixture separation. Root passed 34 focused context, timing, checkpoint, handoff/executor and retained-image tests; the driver owner passed 12 golden cases. These 46 cases are focused verification, not the actual complete Release gate. C476 records the separate E2E-environment prerequisite.
