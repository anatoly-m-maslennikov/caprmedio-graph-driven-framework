# Summary

Repair the sealed N9 Unit failure groups

## Objective

repair the confirmed sealed N9 Unit failure groups without relaxing the accepted release or source-currentness boundaries.

## Details

- this bounded lane feeds a fresh source-bound N10; retain failed N9 without replay.
- root owns Git, integration, source pins, canonical refresh and actual dispatch. workers preserve other lanes' changes.
- local fixture/source acceptance is not full Release acceptance; installed N remains unchanged.

## Definition of Done

all nine bounded repairs have accepted source/code and focused test evidence; a fresh source-bound candidate passes the complete Unit gate before any later Release gate proceeds.

## Observed baseline

### Local repair acceptance

all nine child lanes have bounded local acceptance. source/reader commit 6500fa7d4 has independent source/code review, fifteen reference-context passes and fourteen source-admission passes; fixture commit 50ef09c37 has independent review, two retained-E2E passes and fifty-three mocked image passes. the full step-input/compiler verification also passes five cases after closure repair. the guarded source-pin refresh is actually recorded once as completed event `release-manifest:d4edecd2210a9c51dcf8b998e7db7c43bbe31c0610211a8c9237f9729f379965` at 2026-10-06T16:12:27+04:00, carrier revision 5; strict sixteen-route canonical digest is `ad04152415e6d1d462c73f00815bedb85c6f5452d14138e6e61c6e6ebee8cac7`. historical Journal prefixes and installed N are unchanged. this parent remains Active until a fresh complete candidate Unit gate passes.

N9 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N9` completed source delivery and compilation. its actual Unit receipt has exit code 1, elapsed 816.0929900840056 seconds, and 1,925 reported testcases with 16 failures, 57 errors and zero skipped. terminal interruption receipts exist for the Action, Step and Workflow; no event remains pending. no candidate image, promotion or retirement resulted. retain those exact results and the installed N selector.
