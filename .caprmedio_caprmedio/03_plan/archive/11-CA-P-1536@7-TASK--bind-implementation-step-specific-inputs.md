# Summary

Bind Implementation Step-specific inputs

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, repair only O016 Step-specific parameter selection and retained state propagation in the existing graph executor.

## Details

Own selected_execution.py's Implementation adapter/state handoff and tests/test_selected_execution.py only. Read current P1517, D545, O016 and its Steps/Actions, plus IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW/implementation_actions.py and source_bindings.json. Current adapter passes identical parameters to every Step although source requires Integrated/Isolated per Step; fix using manifest-selected Step-specific input with checked current M projection and R/D/E targets, carry performed outputs/evidence/retry state to the next actual Step, never add hardcoded successor policy. Test the real seven-Action prompt handlers through an injected mock Agent, not stand-ins bypassing packet validation; expected failing baseline then passing traversal and blocked/missing input. Preserve existing BaseRevise and all other native handlers. No Codex/HTTP transport, backend, MCP, source/RMED or actual Project mutation; later transport and image proof remain separate. You are not alone, preserve others and use apply_patch. Publish API and truthful remaining wiring.

### Definition of Done

The exact bounded result, changed files, source pins and actual verification are saved with truthful remainder. No broader implementation or immutable-image proof is implied.

## Result

Implemented Step-specific selection in `selected_execution.py`: `parameters.base_packet` plus `parameters.step_packets[manifest Step ID]`, explicit Integrated/Isolated context checks, actual prior Action outputs/evidence in `prior_results` and `retained_state.prior_results`, and source-edge compatible diagnosis labels. Fourteen focused Docker development-worker tests pass, including real seven prompt Action handlers through injected mock Agent on failed-check/diagnose/retry/repair/passed traversal. Scoped diff check passes. Backend/real Agent transport and image proof remain separate. The retry traversal uses a bounded session mock: actual shared Run support currently predeclares only one visit per Step, so durable retry revisit needs a separately bound continuation before P1517 can be Done.
