# Summary

Review the shared run journaling contract

## Objective

Complete one independent read-only source packet review in one assigned subagent, estimate <=15 minutes, inheriting CA-P-1117 v3's 90% threshold.

### Bound input and ownership

Independent review of Done P1443's J01-J08 composed contract and exact current R1720/R1525/R1728/R1463/R1491/R1643/D340 authorities. Reviewer distinct from packet author p1313.

Own only this Plan. Confirm all Workflow/Action runs, standalone/nested/no-op/fail/cancel, exact definitions/lineage/input/result/effects, canonical admitted Event Types, receipts/storage-recovery-without-replay and derived views. Do not force new source R/O if existing claims suffice. Qualify contract for next RMED stage, not implementation acceptance; no source/code/Journal edits.

Read current Epic/source stage and this leaf. You are not alone: preserve peers' edits. Root owns typed Concerns, fixes and shared saves. No harvest/FPF/unrelated audit. Review actual clauses, not titles or metadata as proof.

### Output and verification

Save exact source revisions, bounded scenario verdicts, meaningful gaps/disposition and downstream readiness here. Reopen the saved Plan and confirm registered fields/headings/identity/whitespace. Record actual first/end clocks. Physically Done only for a complete review output; issues can remain explicitly gated but are not a clean source pass. No more than four changed Operations are reviewed in this leaf.

## Details

### Independent review result

Original first clock2026-10-04 16:52:28 UTC remains unchanged. This reviewer is distinct from P1443's packet author p1313. Read complete physical Done P1443v1 at `done/10-CA-P-1443-TASK--bind-shared-workflow-and-action-run-journaling.md`, including all J01–J08, seven producer walkthroughs and retained limits; no producer pass was inferred from its Done status. Read current Epic P1117v3, source stage P1119v3 and P1132v3 completely and re-read Goal13. Nineteen prior full Goal/Principle/Carrier reads were live-qualified unchanged, including all fourteen active Project Principles. Current P1132v3 retains the selected source scope and independent-review gates; the producer's earlier P1132v2 is historical provenance, not substituted current authority.

Verdict: accept the composed J01–J08 contract as sufficient source-grounded input for the next reviewed PROGRAMMATIC specification. No missing reusable Core Claim, duplicate R/O, source mutation or new Event Type is required. This is independent contract acceptance, not acceptance of instrumentation, Journal receipts, all selected source Workflows or runtime behavior. Zero changed Operations are reviewed here.

### Exact current authority

Fully read the seven bound authoritative Core carriers below. Paths are relative to `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/`, not projected copies:

- R1720v17: `04_requirement/CA-R-1720-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--use-one-project-journal-for-governed-provenance.md`.
- R1525v6: `04_requirement/CA-R-1525-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--bind-workflow-runs-to-exact-definition-revisions.md`.
- R1728v16: `04_requirement/CA-R-1728-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE--record-every-projection-rebuild-in-a-journal.md`.
- R1463v7: `04_requirement/CA-R-1463-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--derive-log-views-from-the-shared-journal.md`.
- R1491v6: `04_requirement/CA-R-1491-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--keep-project-validation-out-of-journal-admission.md`.
- R1643v22: `04_requirement/CA-R-1643-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-REQUIREMENT--register-type-values-for-work-journal-events.md`.
- D340v11: `07_delivery/CA-D-340-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL-DELIVERY--serialize-work-journal-event-properties.md`.

Also fully read the eleven direct supporting source locators in P1443's exact registry: R1452v10/R1509v6/R1510v4/R1511v5/R1513v4/R1519v5/R1520v5/R1526v4/R1644v17/R1745v16/D308v11. Their actual clauses support Action/Step/Run distinctions, terminal handoff, execution-kind limits, fact-bound recovery and append-only canonical history. No standalone receipt schema is falsely attributed to R1525: its applicability is Workflow Runs; P1117v3's explicit selected-delivery contract supplies standalone Action Run identity, exact definition and result/receipt obligations.

### Bounded clause and scenario verdicts

| Contract group / scenario | Independent verdict and source boundary |
| --- | --- |
| J01: Workflow with two Action invocations; standalone Action; nested invocation/handoff | Accept. R1452/R1509/R1510/R1511 distinguish definitions, actual executions and Journal records; R1520 preserves actual predecessor/successor associations without implying successor authorization/start. Distinct Run IDs and real parent lineage are required; Tool calls or pending evidence delivery do not manufacture Runs. Standalone execution has no invented parent. |
| J02: exact definition/input bindings; changed/unavailable definition during dispatch/recovery | Accept. R1525v6 preserves original completed bindings/effects, pauses further dispatch and requires recorded revalidation; it neither freezes mutable target state/permissions nor resets retries. P1117 supplies the selected standalone Action binding, with safe references/redaction rather than secrets. |
| J03: success, no-op, failure/partial effects, cancellation, never-started request or interrupted work | Accept. Every actual selected Workflow/Action Run has start, actual result/effects and one truthful terminal when it ends; interrupted ongoing work is not presumed terminal. R1510/R1511 require actual execution evidence, R1520 rejects completed requested work while continuation remains pending. No-op has no fictitious Artifact mutation, and never-started work has no fabricated Run. |
| J04: canonical event representation and cancellation/no-op outcomes | Accept as next-stage binding, not a finished serializer. Only R1643v22's Started/Progressed/Completed/Failed/Interrupted/Abandoned/Recovered values are admitted; D340v11 requires Event/Action identity/kind, Author, timezone-qualified actual time, session provenance and Structural Scope. J04 deliberately requires the next RMED to bind truthful cancellation/outcome representation; it invents neither Canceled/NoOp enums nor a universal mapping. Unknown historical facts remain explicit under R1644. |
| J05: Action effects occurred but terminal append failed; identical/conflicting append retries | Accept. R1491v6 requires same-identity/same-payload idempotence and rejects conflicting overwrite; R1745/D308 preserve admitted append-only history. Actual effects and pending evidence remain visible until a real durable receipt. Recovery retries recording, not the Action, and does not invent time/outcome or reset the admitted retry allowance. An acknowledgment without persistence is not journaled completion. |
| J06: Artifact Change Log/Process Log reconstruction; read-only/no-op history | Accept. R1720/R1463/R1745 supply one canonical historical authority, event-referenced derived views, reconstructable declared selection and explicit incomplete/stale coverage. Both views may reference one Event without duplicating history; correction appends a traceable source record, not an independently edited log. |
| J07: each of the three Projection builders succeeds, fails or remains incomplete | Accept. R1728v16 binds every attempt's target, exact source revisions/Journal selection, generator/configuration, start/terminal and produced Revision only when successful. Shared Workflow/Action evidence still applies; generator presence, generation mode or receipt alone cannot certify complete current Projection behavior or confer authority. |
| J08: historical nonconforming value; unsafe/malformed payload; Programmatic/Agentic responsibility | Accept. R1491/D340 separate event/storage integrity from Project grammar and preserve observed identifiers/values; unsafe append fails with pending evidence retained. R1644 rejects invented historical facts. R1526 classifies the actual delegated responsibility, not transport; journaling grants no mutation permission, source conformance or new Action/Step merely for a Tool call. |

### Disposition and downstream readiness

No actionable source-contract defect or unresolved authority conflict was found in this bound review; no shared Concern request is needed. Existing sources suffice within the Epic's expressly admitted selected-delivery scope. This does not broaden their universal applicability or independently create a Core Action Run model.

Root must bind the exact next PROGRAMMATIC R/M/E/D carriers and generic Workflow/Action entrypoint instrumentation plus its durable append/receipt interface. The reviewed specification must explicitly settle admitted event/outcome and cancellation representation, standalone/nested identity/lineage/currentness, redacted input/result/effect references and recording blockers/recovery. Later functional Docker/MCP cases must prove both Run levels, successful no-op/failure/canceled and partial effects, currentness changes, identical/conflicting append retries without replay, Projection provenance and single-source view reconstruction. These are retained next-stage obligations, not missing Claims to patch here or observed runtime passes.

P1132 source-stage aggregation and P1158/P1160 dependent bindings remain root-owned; this leaf alone unlocks neither implementation nor the full source stage. Only this Plan is edited; producer P1443, all source carriers, code, Journal, parents/peers and shared Concerns remain untouched. No harvest or FPF is performed.

### Actual saved review and clock

The complete saved Plan was reopened and the small saved carrier check passed2026-10-04 16:58:49 UTC: duplicate-key-safe YAML, registered Summary/Objective/Details, exact identity/Summary/Version1, current/target Scope fields, one EOF newline, eight complete J01–J08 independent verdict groups, literal DoD and decomposition/BLOCKS retained, unique P1451 carrier. Actual clause/scenario review above supplies the substantive proof; metadata/counts do not certify semantic or runtime coverage.

Review end/physical Done2026-10-04 16:59:54 UTC, elapsed446seconds from unchanged first16:52:28 UTC, within the15-minute estimate. Only this Plan moves to its local done folder with Status Done; Objective, Summary, Version1 and BLOCKS P1132/P1158/P1160 remain unchanged. No actionable source-contract defect or unresolved remainder prevents this review's completion. Required next RMED bindings and later implementation/runtime proof are retained explicitly, not reported Done.

### Definition of Done

Truthful bounded independent result and exact evidence exist; any actual issue/remainder is reported to root for typed disposition before affected code proceeds. No unexecuted Runtime or journal coverage is claimed.
