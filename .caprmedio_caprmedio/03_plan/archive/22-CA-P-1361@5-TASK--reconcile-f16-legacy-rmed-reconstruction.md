# Summary

Reconcile F16 legacy RMED reconstruction

## Objective

Reconcile exactly one F16 primary entry, CA-A-1063 R0119 / S026 / W2, with current source Operations; retain covered, gap, rejected and non-operational dispositions in CA-A-1079. One assigned AI Agent; estimate <=15 minutes from the unchanged first actual clock, 2026-10-04 12:56:53 UTC. Binding and governing-source intake are included, not a clock reset. This is authorized CAPRMEDIO reconciliation, not a new FPF invocation.

### Exact bound inputs

- `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1063-ANALYSIS_RPRT--consolidate-the-closed-corpus-candidate-register.md`: the source_entry_assignments row R0119 = F16, cross-tags F12/F10, S026, entry 2, W2; the F16 family row and first_bounded_input_entries declaration only. One primary entry, not a claim that its cross-tag families are reconciled.
- `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-933-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-next-third-partition-session-packet.md` v1: saved candidate W2, with H07/EV03 qualifiers, within lines 1–93 before “Complete native record provenance, text and dispositions.” Do not open native sessions or read raw embedded blocks. No other A933 candidate is admitted.
- Current Goal v13 at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/ANATOLY-MASLENNIKOV-DEFINES_GOAL_FOR-caprmedio--create-and-evolve-a-working-caprmedio-framework.md`; fourteen active Project Principles R819 v13, R1490 v1, R1407 v5, R1420 v5, R1421 v4, R1423 v4, M001 v10, M002 v15, M005 v8, M006 v8, M261 v5, E001 v12, P032 v5 and P033 v9. Root R004 v18 and R1799 v1 additionally constrain control and execution authorization. All were fully read from their current root carriers.
- Current CA-P-1117 v2, CA-P-1119 v2 and CA-P-1130 v5 at their existing governing Plan paths; inherited 90% confidence, closed harvest, source destinations and remaining stage gates apply. Saved gates found P1130 changed v3→v4→v5; both changed full carriers were reread. Its twenty-family declaration and historical-support clarification confirm this F16 ownership and keep authoring gated; they do not expand this leaf or adopt historical proposals.
- Exact Operation source directory S = `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/`:
  - `S/CA-O-016-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--implement-evaluations-before-required-behavior.md` v11.
  - `S/CA-O-017-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--prepare-implementation-work.md` v6.
  - `S/CA-O-010-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--reconcile-sources.md` v7.
  - `S/CA-O-006-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--propose-source-corrections.md` v6.
  - `S/CA-O-007-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--obtain-source-correction-decisions.md` v6.
  - `S/CA-O-008-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--apply-approved-source-corrections.md` v11.
  - `S/CA-O-019-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--implement-requirements.md` v4.
- Source Plan/carrier controls R1589 v4, R1580 v4, D460 v6, D470 v7, D461 v6 and D479 v6 in the same `001_CORE_META_MODEL` source layer. Current revisions prevail; reread any changed bound source before disposition.

### Ownership, result and exclusions

Own only this Plan, `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1079-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-f16-legacy-rmed-reconstruction.md`, and conditional `.caprmedio_caprmedio/01_concern/CA-C-362-PROBLEM--retain-the-f16-evidence-read-boundary-failure.md`. Preserve all concurrent work. No Operation/RMED/code, parent Plan, runtime/settings, Git or Journal writes; no harvesting or historical command execution. The initial broad A933 locator returned raw embedded-record excerpts; record this actual read-boundary failure and exclude those excerpts from the comparison rather than claiming pristine scope.

Return one compact proposition table covering the legacy window, observation provenance, absent initial RMED/Journal, preserve/change/unknown decisions, provisional specification, scoped acceptance, downstream refactoring/evaluation, Projection non-authority and unresolved face/value/generation particulars. Give exact reusable CORE_META_MODEL versus caprmedio-specific PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination and the minimum independent-review/RMED/runtime follow-up; no new source ID or accepted Claim is authored here.

### Verification scenario and completion gate

After the Plan exists, fully read the seven bound Operations, compare every W2 constituent with exact current clauses and preserve historical human intent versus assistant proposals/reports. Read back the saved Analysis and conditional Concern; check unique IDs, registered headings, one EOF newline, exact Plan ownership/decomposition/BLOCKS, unchanged current authority revisions, Active parent/gated dependents and local acyclicity. This carrier/completeness check is not implementation/runtime proof or a second semantic analysis. Root owns stage roll-up and independent review. Only after it passes mark this leaf Done and move its one file into the same local container's `done/` under D461. Keep the parent Active and its existing gates intact.

### Completed packet and actual proof

CA-A-1079 dispositions all twelve W2 constituents: four covered, four gap rows forming one minimal G1, two rejected interpretations and two non-operational/deferred particulars. Reuse O016/O017/O019 downstream and the existing conflict-correction decision domain; G1 remains a proposed CORE legacy-evidence/provisional-RMED preparation contribution for independent review, not adopted source authority. Root owns that review and subsequent source/RMED/runtime leaves.

The bounded saved gate returned PASS / exit 0 at 2026-10-04 13:12:12 UTC: strict YAML/registered headings, three unique owned carriers, twelve constituent rows, one EOF newline, thirteen current source Operation/Plan-control revisions, fourteen Principle carriers, current P1130 v5 and six-node local decomposition/BLOCKS DAG. P1130/P1119/P1117 and authoring P1131/P1156 remain Active. This receipt proves carrier/comparison completeness, not implementation or runtime.

Actual first clock remains 2026-10-04 12:56:53 UTC; gate elapsed 15m19s. Closure write clock 2026-10-04 13:13:47 UTC / actual elapsed 16m54s; the <=15-minute estimate was overrun. Intake scope recovery and concurrent-control gate retries consumed the excess; no clock reset, false partial-to-Done claim or hidden remainder is used. C362 retains the genuine intake scope failure and timing; normal root control amendments are not classified as semantic/execution defects. No owned comparison work remains unfinished. The one Done file is placed in the same container's done/ under D461; parent and stage gates are unchanged.

## Details

### Definition of Done

The leaf is not Done if any constituent of R0119/W2 lacks a disposition and current-source reference, historical proposals/reports are treated as live adoption, the minimum gap/destination/follow-up or actual scope failure is concealed, its saved result/carrier check fails, or required source/ownership/stage gates are bypassed. A real blocker or incomplete remainder retains truthful unfinished status rather than false Done.
