# Summary

Bind observed Draft promotion finalization

## Objective

Within <=5 minutes, bind observed Draft promotion finalization.

## Details

Repair only D569/D570's P1676 publication-order contradiction. Use a non-consuming private pending transition, exact planned-output and request binding, and append finalized promotion history only after the actual exact non-Draft output is observed. A failed write/finalization remains truthful pending repair; retry cannot silently choose another identity. Reservations are existing ephemeral runtime handoffs, not canonical history, new identity registry or Journal authority. Only finalized history consumes the Draft head. Preserve exact predecessors and the accepted head/source rules. Source-only, no code/runtime/Plans/Git writes.

## Definition of Done

Save exact current source and archive hashes. P1676 independently reviews the repaired ordering before any native history implementation.

## Result

Final source acceptance: D568@5 SHA-256 64d2e60303d9dceeaee694263ebd888daf4bd217a794830896b1c5837517559d, D570@4 462ff2638fdba7050c83c27c9a8f974c1008c431cb46b4d8d81212d207ea1f37 and D569@5 ada92dcacfcf906878e3c3e3964281abd8e9c8b99336042564d565d2a79dd523. The unique current acyclic head and private non-consuming exact-transition reservation are independently accepted by P1676; only observed output finalizes consuming history. Every saved predecessor archive matches exact reviewed bytes. No code/runtime/Journal or promotion effect is claimed.
