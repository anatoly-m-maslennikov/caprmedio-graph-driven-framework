# Summary

Repair the compiler and cutover fixture expectations

## Objective

repair compiler dry-run input, governed delivery path and interrupted cutover expectations without relaxing the accepted release or source-currentness boundaries.

## Details

- this bounded lane feeds a fresh source-bound N10; retain failed N9 without replay.
- root owns Git, integration, source pins, canonical refresh and actual dispatch. workers preserve other lanes' changes.
- local fixture/source acceptance is not full Release acceptance; installed N remains unchanged.

## Definition of Done

20bf097ff; two compiler and two cutover cases pass; full step-input module awaits the Prompt closure lane.
