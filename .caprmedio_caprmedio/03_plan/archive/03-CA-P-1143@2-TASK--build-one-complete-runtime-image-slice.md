# Summary

Build one complete runtime image slice

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for build one complete runtime image slice, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Bind one reviewed image specification and exact Docker/build/entrypoint files. Include canonical implementation code, needed prompt assets, workflow definitions/source resolution, MCP, and Tool dependencies as declared by the coverage matrix. Use required project data mounts, not undeclared host implementation code or host Python packages. Build locally; no registry push, deployment, or authentication changes are authorized by this Plan.

### Required output

A successful local image build with image ID/digest, build context/source revisions, dependency evidence and entrypoint smoke result for this family. Split larger build/config changes and remaining image families into <=15-minute leaves; build completion is not functional completion.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
