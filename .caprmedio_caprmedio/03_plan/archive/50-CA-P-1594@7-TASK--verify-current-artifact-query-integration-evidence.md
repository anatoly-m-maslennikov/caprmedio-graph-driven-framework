# Summary

Verify current artifact query integration evidence

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, read the current P1527–P1529 acceptance chain and run existing focused artifact-query and shared-action tests. Verify identifier-first, filtering, section fetching, snapshots, diagnostics and read-only boundaries. Read-only; separate development-worker proof from MCP and immutable-image acceptance.

## Details

This is one independently owned Epic Task. Preserve concurrent edits, use no FPF or harvesting, and ask the Operator below the selected 90% confidence threshold. Root records the Task result and commits related validated changes.

## Saved result

Read-only development-worker proof passed 23 tests: 11 Artifact Tool, 7 shared filter and 5 selected-action cases. Covers IDs default, properties and sections, retained snapshots and continuation, typed grammar, diagnostics, bounded reads and secret/read-only boundaries. P1527 discovery/MCP and P1528 image proof remain separate.

## Definition of Done

Exact passing cases and any remaining query integration acceptance gates are recorded without unsupported closure.
