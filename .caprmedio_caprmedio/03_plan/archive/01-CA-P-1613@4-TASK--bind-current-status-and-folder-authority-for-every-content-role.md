# Summary

Bind current status and folder authority for every Content Role

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, bind the current authoritative status whitelists and Delivery folder mappings to the existing Change Atom Status Workflow and necessary Tool RMED. Correct only demonstrated source gaps; reuse existing definitions instead of creating duplicate status authority.

## Details

### Inputs

All applicable Content Role and specialized Type status definitions and Carrier folder rules in methodology; CA-O-127/129/128 and current status Tool RMED. Record exact source IDs/Versions/paths/hashes and whether any definition is missing.

### Output and ownership

One coherent O/RMED packet explaining how the implementation resolves current status/folder authority for any Atom, including Drafts and current identity rules. Defined same-status no-op, invalid/missing model, collision, history/reference diagnostics and shared recording boundaries remain explicit.

## Definition of Done

Exact source pins and destination ownership support independent CA-P-1614 review. Ask unresolved material choices below90%; do not silently invent whitelist values, folder policies, mandatory transition restrictions or a second authoritative registry.

## Result

The saved qualified O packet, Role status defaults and Tool model/destination repair are complete and independently accepted by CA-P-1633. R1874/R1875 register the Operator-approved O and A domains. P1632 supplies only the literal archived-Revision Carrier link already implied by D466/D289. No archived legacy Carrier is moved. Complete accepted source pins follow.
