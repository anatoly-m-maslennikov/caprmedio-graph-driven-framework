# Summary

Bind pinned candidate compilation interface

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, bind pinned candidate compilation interface.

## Details

Read-only bounded preflight first: inspect compiler source and D561/E572 requirement for pinned selected-snapshot compile without authority rewrite or C447 relocation bypass. Propose smallest exact adapter/change and test surface, preserving nested source recursive digest success/failure. No actual copy/compile/migration/image, no new second compiler.

Inputs are P1622 accepted source/RMED pins: O164–179@1, R1876–1880@1, M331–333@1, E571–574@1, D560–564@1. D561/E572 are the repaired accepted pins, not their rejected predecessors. Preserve external dirt and designated C447/C449 boundaries; existing development worker tests are not fresh-image proof.

## Definition of Done

Save exact bounded output and test/remaining-coverage evidence. Pure preparation, staging or source review never establishes release promotion, complete P1623, P1624 or Epic closure.

## Result

Read-only preflight identified the existing compiler entrypoint and private MethodologyPaths/compile_report/projection_bytes/stage_outputs/replace_outputs_atomically reuse surface. Public run_request rewrites the canonical Projection and is excluded. P1668/P1669 have now bound and independently accepted the D571@2 pure expected-byte preflight and child-only actual-render equality contract at95%; P1650 owns its implementation. This interface preparation performs no copy/compile/package/runtime effect and does not count as actual compiler proof.
