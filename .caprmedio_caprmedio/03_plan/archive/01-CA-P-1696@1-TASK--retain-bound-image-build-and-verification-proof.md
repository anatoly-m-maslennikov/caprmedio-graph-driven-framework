# Summary

Retain bound image build and verification proof

## Objective

Retain P1691's actual completed build/verification implementation and focused proof.

## Details

The original assigned image Agent implemented and tested this bounded frontier within thirteen minutes. build_candidate_image, verify_candidate_image and verify_bound_image_evidence bind exact complete package/private context, pinned Dockerfile/dependency inputs, immutable ID, fixed executable canary and retained receipt/artifacts. Fifteen focused fake-Docker cases pass; current inventory regressions repeat those fifteen passes. No live image proof is claimed.

## Definition of Done

Save exact code/test hashes and actual focused case outcomes, distinguishing mock evidence from actual image execution. Parent and actual release gates remain separate.
