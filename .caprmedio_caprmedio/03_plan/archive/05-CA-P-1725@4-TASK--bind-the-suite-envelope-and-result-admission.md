# Summary

Bind the suite envelope and result admission

## Objective

Integrate the immutable source-binding envelope and exact report admission into the existing sealed Release suite boundary.

## Details

Own release_suite.py, release_suite_execution.py and tests/test_release_suite_bindings_handoff.py. Materialize the trusted closed envelope before read-only mounting; supply its digest through the sealed environment; verify exact per-case properties and probes after execution. No new public selector, MCP route or Workflow. Expected bounded work: <=15 minutes; decompose if needed.

## Definition of Done

Focused handoff tests prove readonly input, exact environment/digest binding and truthful refusal of altered or incomplete reports.

## Results

Schema-2 immutable envelope, private context receipt, report/context digest admission and fresh trusted pre-/post-execution bindings are saved in 689dd212f. Fourteen handoff/executor tests and two independent timing tests pass. The source-derived package and canonical sixteen-route contracts are unchanged.
