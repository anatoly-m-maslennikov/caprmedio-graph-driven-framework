# Summary

Audit the complete epic closure matrix

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for audit the complete epic closure matrix, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Use all parent-stage completion results. Bind at most twenty matrix rows per leaf and add further audit leaves if needed. Reconcile all session frontiers, adopted/rejected/already-covered decisions, subagent findings, Concerns, capability coverage and built-image evidence. Record truthful status, not an implementation claim from plan authoring alone.

### Required output

A final complete closure matrix and Operator handoff; Epic remains Active while any required work, unresolved blocking Concern, missing session coverage, missing Docker execution evidence, or required review remains. Concerns with justified nonblocking disposition remain visible rather than erased.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
