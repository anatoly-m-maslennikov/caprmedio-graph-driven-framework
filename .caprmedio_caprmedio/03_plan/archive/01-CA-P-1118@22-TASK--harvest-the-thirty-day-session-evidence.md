# Summary

Harvest the thirty-day session evidence

## Objective

Retain completed partial harvest evidence and its exact stop frontier after the Operator stopped further harvesting. Continue the Epic through root-governed downstream work using existing saved evidence, without treating assistant proposals as Operator decisions or this canceled stage as completed.

### Work decomposition

This canceled composite and its subtree preserve recoverable completed and unfinished history. Do not execute or add harvest leaves. Remaining harvest Plans are explicitly canceled while Done descendants retain their own statuses and evidence.

This task is not Done and no full-stage coverage is asserted. It is detached from required Epic decomposition and supplies no outgoing blocking gate; root separately updates downstream continuation scope from the Operator stop instruction.

### Operator stop disposition

Operator stopped further harvesting and ordered Epic continuation from existing saved evidence. This Plan is Canceled, not Done. No native session was read and no future harvest leaf was executed for this closure. Outgoing BLOCKS are removed, preserving completed descendant statuses and evidence. Retained bindings and earlier readiness/frontier statements are historical unexecuted evidence, not authority for more harvesting. Root owns downstream scope and continuation decisions.

Administrative stop frontier: 102 completed substantive packets / 5463 of 13011 indexed records; PRIMARY 4504/6588 and workers 959/6423. Exactly 7548 records are not completed: 2084 PRIMARY and 5464 workers. Interrupted P1325/A1043 contributes zero completed records; its 27 partial records are excluded. Context-only and future bindings also add zero. This is partial harvest cessation, not full source/window/month completion or adopted Operations. P1118 is detached from required Epic P1117 decomposition because Canceled work cannot satisfy that completion gate. All 16 still-Active harvest Plans are explicitly Canceled; 114 pre-existing Done carriers retain status and exact bytes. Completed reports remain available for separately governed downstream reconciliation. No further harvest work is created.

Administrative closure receipt at 2026-10-04 12:29:15 UTC: the retained subtree has 130 Plan carriers, 16 Canceled and 114 Done, with zero Active harvest Plans. All 114 Done files match their pre-closure bytes exactly; saved bindings of canceled Plans are unchanged. Five canceled file/directory bundles have correct status placement; three already-Done matching bundles remain preserved. P1118 has no IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF or outgoing BLOCKS, and no canceled descendant has outgoing BLOCKS. A1043 remains excluded partial evidence; C344 is administratively resolved without claiming the interrupted completion gate. The stated 102-packet/5463-record frontier is the Operator/root stop frontier; no session reading or new harvest occurred during closure.

## Details

### Prior harvest checkpoint — 93 completed packets (superseded by administrative stop)

Ten completed leaves P1310–1313 and P1318–1323 add 232 mutually disjoint whole native records: 141 PRIMARY and 91 worker dispositions. Current coverage is 4,464/6,588 PRIMARY plus 894/6,423 workers, 5,358/13,011 total; 7,653 remain. Context-only records and future bindings add zero coverage. Original-main first is 720/1,869 refined (1,149 remain; 1,157 under the retained original count), original-main second is 624/624; continuation second is 444/759 (315 remain), third 1,175/1,175, final 1,284/1,284. Other PRIMARY frontiers are 23/80 first, 27/443 second and 36/223 third, leaving 57/416/187 respectively. Final PRIMARY remains 1,415/1,415. Worker partitions are 21/474, 19/476, 28/1,422 and 826/4,051, leaving 453/457/1,394/3,225. Every exact frozen-window/source/identity/continuation frontier and separate post-cutoff amendment remains retained.

All ten assigned leaves are physically Done. Their saved Analyses A1028–1031 and A1036–1041 preserve complete originals, required full contexts, native parts and individual dispositions. The packet groups are provisional, overlapping retrieval/refinement records, not adopted or deduplicated Operations. Historical assistant reports, machine context and native user-role wrappers do not create fresh Operator decisions or current implementation proof.

Actual next Active, unexecuted leaves are P1314/A1032, P1315/A1033, P1316/A1034, P1317/A1035, P1324/A1042, P1325/A1043, P1326/A1044, P1327/A1045, P1328/A1046 and P1329/A1047. Every next binding retains its whole first/following boundary and full required contexts. The ten Analysis IDs remain reserved/uncreated at this checkpoint. Parents P1126–1129 and P1118 remain Active; P1119/P1130/P1155 retain their full-harvest gates and cannot execute yet.

Actual original clocks were retained. Interrupted P1310–1313 and completed P1318/P1319/P1322 exceeded their estimates; C330–335/C338 retain the actual interruption, transport/schema/race recovery and elapsed evidence. P1320/P1321/P1323 completed within their original fifteen-minute estimates. C331 remains active/nonblocking for disclosed interruption/overrun; the other assigned recovery Concerns are physically resolved after their required proof. No clock reset or missing read was accepted.

Root integration compared every one of the 232 new selected native identities and supplied timestamp/role/line/offset/bytes/raw/text metadata to the frozen index: no overlap, context credit or future-binding credit. The agents' native/saved/current-authority/Carrier/placement checks passed; the shared duplicate-rejecting YAML, registered headings/fields, unique-ID and completion/BLOCKS-DAG check passed 167 Plans and 139 supporting Carriers. All 51 exact owned old/new paths passed scoped whitespace checks; all 47 present carriers have exactly one terminal newline. Mechanical commit fc6e569608a40cfc8499ca84f6f4cf77df3e4174 matches all 47 actual saved carrier states. The existing Journal API appended and reopened 47 sealed recovered-state events; prediction/receipt/digest/Git/saved-byte comparisons passed, bringing owned recorded states to 408 before this receipt update. These are required persistence/provenance gates, not an added semantic-review stage, save-Tool receipt or full-month acceptance.

Prior checkpoint 83 was saved in fac583df1850d7f2d42fc9a35c9ef7095fe0d51b with 22 actual saved recovered Carrier states, bringing owned recorded states to 361. Shared Journal Git save remains pending because it also contains unrelated pre-existing events; no save-Tool receipt is fabricated. No O/RMED authoring, Engine implementation, Settings/service mutation or complete Docker verification has executed under this Epic.

All lower checkpoints are historical and superseded.



### Prior checkpoint 83 — retained historical totals

83 completed packets retain4323 unique PRIMARY dispositions and803 worker dispositions,5126total. Original-main first719/second624; continuation second431/third1134/final1284, plus72README/59TOOL_R finalPRIMARY. PRIMARYbaseline6588 leaves2265; workerbaseline6423 leaves5620; total7885unprocessed. FinalPRIMARY1415/1415 complete; finalworkers803/4051,3248remain. Every other frozen source/window/identity frontier remains, including746otherPRIMARY records and earlier-partition worker records. Context and future bindings addzero processed records; machine wrappers do not create human decisions.

The completed round P1305/A1023(first8whole), P1307/A1025(third56whole), P1308/A1026(final60workerwhole) and rootP1309/A1027(second27whole) retains151whole records and23overlapping provisional refinements. Total406packet-level group/refinement dispositions is not406adopted or deduplicated Operations. P1305 preserves the literal instruction to consider both findings and proposed fixes; P1307 preserves successive citation and Carrier decisions; P1308 preserves narrow QA withdrawals and prototype/report limits; P1309 preserves policy, lifecycle, evaluation and Journal boundaries. Assistant reports, historical wrappers and bindings never establish current implementation or fresh human decisions.

All four leaves are physically Done. Actual next leaves are bound but unexecuted: P1310/A1028(onewhole with four complete antecedents63036characters, whole-report exception); P1311/A1029(41whole/53antecedents26528characters plus701whole partition4 boundary=27229); P1312/A1030(23whole/four sources27252plus4827full antecedents=32079); P1313/A1031(13whole positions432–444/16000plus16246full antecedents=32246). Following whole frontiers remain intact. First1150refined/1158original remain, second328, selected-source third41, final3248workers. Parents1126–1129/1118 remain Active;1119/1130/1155 remain blocked. Reopening those next-stage Plans confirms their full-harvest/current-authority/exact-destination gates; their authoring/implementation preflights have not executed.

Actual first clocks were never reset: P1305 10:27:31UTC→10:40:32UTC=13m01; P1309 10:28:19UTC→10:37:57UTC=9m38. P1307 terminal check10:48:45.645523UTC from10:27:55 exceeded its estimate by350.65seconds; C327 is active/nonblocking and retains the overrun and resolved diagnostic/persistence failures. P1308 terminal receipts persisted/verified10:46:09UTC from10:28:17=17m52; resolvedC328 retains its overrun and completed recovery. C326 andC329 retain recovered reading/patch/diagnostic failures. ExistingC321–325 dispositions remain; C324 additionally retains and resolves root metadata-versus-completed-evidence schema assumptions. Failed invocations countzero proof or reading.

Actual root integration source/saved proofs pass for current8/context2→next1/context4 with23authority fingerprints, current56/context23→next41/context53/full boundary with26, current60/context2→next23/context8 with34, and current27/context27→next13/context51 with37. Whole native prefix/raw/text/parts/metadata/aggregates, current/next disjointness and physical Done placement are verified. Saved corpus coverage is distinct from these Carrier/provenance proofs; no extra semantic recheck stage or full-month completion is asserted. Global strict151Plans/119supporting Carriers, unique IDs and completion/BLOCKS DAG passed. All26exact owned paths pass the whitespace/save gate;22present Carriers have exactly one terminal newline, with four former Active paths removed for Done placement. These scoped checks do not establish complete-month or runtime acceptance.

P1293's missing author/context and premature Done were rejected and recovered on the same leaf before admission; CA-C-315 records the saved-byte repair. A1011 preserves stable identity/mutable-carrier migration, stalled versus approved bounded audits, coverage/currentness versus implementation proof, Principle-first proposed fixes and faithful report delivery. A1013 preserves scoped authority admission, Entity/Subject resolution, correction-first evaluation, narrow candidate repairs and same-sample rollout gates. A1014 preserves independent semantic criteria despite layout, contextual entities, narrow QA withdrawals, literal authority admission and Principle versus same-tier limits.

Current checkpoint:32 substantive packets retain2354 unique PRIMARY message dispositions.

The original indexed PRIMARY baseline6588 leaves4234 not yet semantically disposed; all6423 worker messages remain substantively unfinished. Per-source machine-context refinements are explicit in the source reports and still require final inventory reconciliation. Indexing13011 messages never counts as reading them.

Prior committed checkpoint9033330aa is real. Its23actualnew savedstates were independently matched to Git bytes and actual sealed recovered-state Journal records; this execution has104events before saving this round. An overly strict whole receipt-object equality assertion failed after append, but independent actualJournal/path/hash/Git checks verify all23states; no duplicateappend or false saveToolcompletionclaim. The shared Journal still has unrelated pre-existing edits; its Git save stays explicitly pending rather than staging unrelated work. This round's direct Git result is recorded separately after verification.

Earlier checkpoint paragraphs below are historical and superseded by these current counts/frontiers.

### Execution checkpoint after the first seven substantive leaves

- Metadata corpus/window preparation1125 is Done; CA-A-905 retains1659 source snapshots/1657 IDs. CA-P-1184/CA-A-910 retain the verified event-window index with6588 PRIMARY and6423 worker canonical messages. Indexing is not semantic harvest.
- Completed substantive leaves1180/1181/1182/1183/1190/1191/1192 retain233 PRIMARY-message dispositions in CA-A-906/907/908/909/912/911/913. The corresponding first/second/third/final primary-main counts are59/60/24/90. These are local source frontiers, not whole-partition completion. All6423 worker messages and other unprocessed PRIMARY messages remain unfinished; overlapping/repeated candidates are not yet adopted.
- The single uncertain candidate has0 canonical monthly messages, proven by complete declared-prefix check1196/CA-A-917. Its sole in-window record is thread-settings metadata. C294 preserves unasserted broader identity as a justified nonblocking limitation. Six other primary sources with0 canonical counts also have no in-window records under a narrow independent metadata check; their exact CA-A-905/910 snapshots remain retained.
- Actual next bound leaves1194/1195/1197/1193 own first/second/third/final source remainders and explicitly block1119/1130/1155. Completed preparation or one local harvest result does not release methodology authoring, specification, implementation or Docker coverage.
- Root's duplicate-rejecting safe-YAML/exact-heading/unique-ID/Done-placement/completion-DAG check passed73 Plans and11 supporting carriers. Missing literal TLDR headings were repaired under resolvedC297; no harvested decision changed. Source identity/coverage checks do not verify historical assistant-reported tests/saves.
- Direct Git saves under the Operator exception are actual commits270e101ed/3af679ac8/523d33fcf/d97cffbc3/f36933b38/1e9be3fd0/359695716/5f7e9e5a6. Root appended25 actual saved-state Journal receipts for then-current committed carriers in addition to three earlier preflight receipts. Already moved/changed historical states remain retrievable in Git, not fabricated as current-carrier receipts. These are recovered-state evidence, not save-Tool completion receipts. The shared Journal has unrelated pre-existing dirty events, so its commit remains an explicit incomplete save disposition rather than staging unrelated work. Later states require their own actual saving/provenance checks.

This composite and all four full partitions remain Active. No source/body has been declared unavailable because of size, copied worker origin or metadata creation dates. Required remainder work and downstream stages remain unfinished.

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if any accessible in-window project session is unprocessed, any unavailable session is hidden instead of linked to a C/Problem, any extracted decision lacks its source and timestamp, or any superseded decision is represented as the current decision. Any required child, remainder, repair or re-review task that is not Done also falsifies completion.
