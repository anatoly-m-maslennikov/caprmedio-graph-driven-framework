# Summary

Repair actual N13 Unit failure groups

## Objective

repair the thirty-four observed N13 Unit failures and errors, then admit a fresh source-bound Release Run after accepted repairs.

## Details

- N13 completed 2,009 tests: 22 failures, 12 errors and no skips in 2441.773051917 seconds; its complete report is .caprmedio_runtime/release_suite/1945f7bf7b02b8550c04a39b57d6e39ead4a4ea3a45b317f4580a7d0bf3713f3/attempt-1sbz9z4g/coverage.xml.
- the six child Tasks own disjoint failure groups. use only confirmed defects, current authority and source-equivalent fixtures.
- preserve N13, its twenty-two recorded Events and all historical evidence; never replay the interrupted Run or infer image/promotion success.
- root integrates sources, exact registration/pin refresh, Git and fresh Run admission. existing Unit and final Release parents remain Active until actual acceptance.

## Definition of Done

the confirmed defect is explained and repaired against current authority; source-equivalent focused regressions have a captured terminal result and independent review accepts the bounded change. actual full Release acceptance remains with the parent Plan.
