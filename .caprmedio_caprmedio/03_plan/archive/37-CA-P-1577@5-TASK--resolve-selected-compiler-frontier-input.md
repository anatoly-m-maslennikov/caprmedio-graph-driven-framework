# Summary

Resolve selected compiler frontier input

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, resolve W13's missing expected_source_frontier_digest at its actual native boundary.

## Details

- Own only the compiler Action adapter and directly related native compiler Tool/tests if a real implementation defect exists. Do not edit the shared golden fixture, strict route proof, executor, sources, MCP, Journal or Plans.
- Keep the declared native compiler request validation strict. If only golden input lacks expected_source_frontier_digest, send the exact current frontier carrier to P1567 without adding permissive production fallback.
- Prove the bounded correct invocation on disposable inputs and retain actual compiled bytes and conflict/currentness semantics; generic failed or dry-run acknowledgement is not completed publication.
- Apply patch, preserve concurrent edits, no commits, FPF, harvesting or live Project effects. Inherit 90%; ask if a required authority decision is unbound.

## Saved result

Fixture-only missing input: obtain current compiler dry-run assessment then use operation apply with that exact source_frontier_digest. Compiler Tool suite passed 32; no production changes justified. Actual native APPLIED exposed a separate shared publication seal failure; P1582 repairs that boundary, not this input Task. Never hardcode the observed assessment digest.

## Definition of Done

The exact compiler input/implementation boundary is resolved with focused evidence or a precise remaining source/fixture gate.
