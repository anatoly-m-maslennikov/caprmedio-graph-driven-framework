# Summary

Review the Agentic context binding slice 2

## Objective

After P1470 is physically Done, independently review only current v2 Steps CA-O-143, CA-O-144, CA-O-146, CA-O-147 against R1527v4/C426 and their v1 histories. Focus on the new binding: explicit supplied runtime context, exactly one Integrated/Isolated choice before Agentic dispatch, no fallback, missing/unsupported/unavailable blocks, Programmatic behavior unaffected. Verify every other clause/input/Action reference/Summary remains unchanged. Historical metadata may differ only by admitted archive Status/Updated At.

Own only this Plan. Do not repeat prior full source reviews or repair any source through review. You are not alone. Estimate <=6 minutes; exact scenario comparison and one saved check. No code, FPF, harvest, Git or Journal writes.

## Details

### Independent review result

PASS, with no findings in the bound slice. P1470 was verified physically in `done/` with status Done before this review. Reviewed the complete current CA-O-143, CA-O-144, CA-O-146 and CA-O-147 v2 carriers, their complete `archive/<same-stem>@1.md` histories, CA-R-1527 v4, CA-C-426 v1, and the relevant current Epic/review-parent controls. All four current sources have Updated At `2026-10-04 17:42:12 +0000`; the archived semantic revisions are v1 with explicitly Archived status and the same actual archive timestamp. This review does not assert original-byte archival provenance.

One focused four-pair whole-file diff gate passed: the only deltas between each complete archive and current source are Archived -> Active, v1 -> v2, and the single intended Agentic context paragraph/bullet replacement. Summaries, IDs, subjects, relations, all input bindings, Action identities, return/result clauses, authority/approval/currentness/retry guards and Workflow transition ownership remain byte-identical outside those exact deltas. The unchanged owning Workflow/Action pairs are O143: O015/O014; O144: O015/O005; O146: O010/O004; O147: O010/O005. Reusable Step definitions remain in CORE_META_MODEL and introduce no duplicate Action or Workflow classification.

The same clause cases were independently checked against R1527v4 for every reviewed Step:

| Actual bound Action / supplied parameter | Required source behavior | Review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agentic / exactly one Integrated, required context/capability available | Resolve the supplied Integrated context before dispatch and retain it with the Step Run. | Pass |
| Agentic / exactly one Isolated, required context/capability available | Resolve the supplied Isolated context before dispatch and retain it with the Step Run. | Pass |
| Agentic / missing, ambiguous or unsupported value | Block that Agentic invocation before dispatch; no default or silent substitution. | Pass |
| Agentic / required context or capability unavailable | Block that Agentic invocation; no fallback. | Pass |
| Programmatic / no Agentic parameter | Existing inputs/dispatch behavior remain applicable; no Agent context is acquired. | Pass |

The admitted invocation's explicitly supplied `agentic_execution_context` is the declared source of the choice, conditional on the actual Action being Agentic. Exactly one Integrated/Isolated choice is required before dispatch; neither mode grants authority. O143/O144 retain context through their unchanged Step Run result clause; O146/O147 explicitly retain it in the new bullet and retain their unchanged Run evidence clause. Programmatic invocation behavior is unaffected because this parameter binding and the block conditions apply only to an actual Agentic Action.

Reviewed source SHA-256 identities: O143 `53f1fdf91b2613e2f1c0da6feb0850ca0d49c535cf6a72df3c11ad2a39694a7c`; O144 `e25fe52d253a413f69971bb21f3d8b66f735269dece226c267bd1af03befa89f`; O146 `47fc11d3062b6a516aff7672143512b4d0dfc0596e57b8b869b305578db7b8ba`; O147 `e01f9c528f0f1626c9e229c3cc2f4c0fd0ba5cc22d97d330599e271cc07d6335`.

Disposition: this slice needs no repair or new Concern. Root retains C426 aggregate/source-stage acceptance and dependent P1132/P1158/P1160 gating. This completed source review supplies no runtime execution, runtime acceptance, Docker, MCP or Journal evidence. Only this Plan was changed; no source, Action, Workflow, code, Journal or Git write was performed.

### Definition of Done

Focused independent result and source revisions are saved, with truthful findings/disposition. Physical Done placement denotes only completed review; root owns C426/source-stage acceptance.
