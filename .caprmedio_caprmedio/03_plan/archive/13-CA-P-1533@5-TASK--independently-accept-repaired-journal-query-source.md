# Summary

Independently accept repaired Journal query source

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, independently accept or reject the repaired Journal source packet before Tool implementation.

## Details

Dispatch only after CA-P-1530 and CA-P-1531 are Done. Read current shared R1850 and the Journal packet's exact pins, CA-P-1524's rejection and active Project Principles. Own only this Plan's pinned disposition, no source/code edits. Verify raw duplicate-key and Event-ID integrity, escaped typed nested selectors/values, append-only retained-prefix validation, bounded resource exhaustion, query's own execution exclusion, secrets, truthful coverage and shared Run-support compatibility.

### Definition of Done

A current exact-ID/Version/path-pinned disposition is saved. CA-P-1526 remains blocked unless this review accepts; source-authoring acceptance is not runtime proof.

## Result

REJECTED by fresh reviewer `/root/accept_journal_query_v2`. Shared CA-R-1850@2 requires absent selectors to compare false and explicit null to remain a value; current CA-R-1869@2 instead rejects absent paths. CA-E-575@2 lacks an explicit per-Event missing-versus-null fixture. This is one source conflict, not a runtime failure. P1534 repairs it; fresh P1535 acceptance replaces this rejected review as the P1526 dispatch gate. All other initial Journal rejection repairs were found covered. No code, Run or Journal writes were performed.

Rejected pins: CA-R-1850@2 SHA-256 `383022199dd56e7c1e0a079e8b1d1ef38008043caa74d1a8f1cb6c3ac92ad822`; CA-R-1869@2 `593e149e6f912006927bdf9b19cc9f401b4c494a7b3ae5fa10240318ec8d9529`; CA-E-575@2 `551a68b1edad142fdf688f6df97588764f2534d8111b2e4cd64b2166d0c67a82`. Their full source paths are those listed in P1523; this review disposition is retained before those two predecessors change.
