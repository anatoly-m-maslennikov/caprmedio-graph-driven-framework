# Summary

Specify entity and term graph capabilities

## Objective

Author one bounded reviewed-implementation specification packet after source-stage acceptance. Inherit P1117's 90% confidence threshold and current Operator-selected thirteen-request scope. Estimate <=15 minutes. No harvesting or FPF.

### Inputs

Current accepted A1142 source registry and root source-stage acceptance P1119/P1132; Operator Goal and relevant active Project Principles. O133v2/O134v2/O135v1/O136v2/O137v2/O138v1, P1453/P1454; current native GENERATE_ENTITY_GRAPH RMED/implementation.

### Ownership and output

WORKFLOW_OPERATIONS/GRAPH_PROJECTIONS authority only plus narrow existing graph RMED updates if necessary; reserve R1835–1838 E555–558 D538–540; no code. You are not alone; preserve others' edits. Use apply_patch. Entities Graph includes declared entities/properties, native source Atoms and declared Scope Unit structure; Terms Graph owns its own relation namespace. Retain exact source traceability, all governed/dependency terms and ancestors/cycles, incomplete/conflicts truth. Required graph-quality failure cannot return built/no-op; never edit authority to fit. Reuse generator where sufficient; functional golden graphs.

RMED must be sufficient for the intended implementation, correctly split by meaning/carrier/construction/assurance and avoid duplicating existing admitted authority. Keep complete Atom properties, Summary/Scope/Claim/Details and truthful exact source references. Save only this packet's output/result. Code implementation waits for independent RMED review. Record gaps/uncertainty to root; do not expand into another source campaign.

### Verification

Reopen owned saved carriers; check their properties, one coherent claim/scope, source-driven functional cases and exact input/output contract. Report actual paths/IDs/versions and remaining issues. Static authoring is not a runtime pass.

## Details

### Result

Physical Done at 2026-10-04 18:40:00 UTC. Saved only the graph-projection RMED packet: CA-R-1835v1 through CA-R-1838v1, CA-E-555v1 through CA-E-558v1, and CA-D-538v1 through CA-D-540v1 under `102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/201_FEATURE_TOOLS/WORKFLOW_OPERATIONS/GRAPH_PROJECTIONS/`.

The packet specifies distinct Entities and Terms builders, exact Atom/Claim/Project Structure source evidence, strict request/result contracts, stable deterministic output, currentness/quality gates, explicit incomplete/conflicting/stale/malformed/cycle/self-reference truth, non-authoritative persistence, and shared Run/Journal receipt references without a duplicate schema. It retains `GENERATE_ENTITY_GRAPH` as a declared existing future entrypoint and authorizes no code before independent RMED review. The golden cases specify complete Entity/Term, invalid frontier/cycle/malformed/self-reference, determinism, destination, nonmutation, and recording-boundary proof.

A proportionate saved-carrier identity/section/source-reference check and `git diff --check` passed. These are static authoring checks, not runtime, MCP, or Docker proof. Independent RMED review remains required before code.

### Definition of Done

The bounded specification or acceptance packet is saved with exact owned outputs and one proportionate check, ready for independent review. Implementation remains gated; root owns aggregate acceptance.
