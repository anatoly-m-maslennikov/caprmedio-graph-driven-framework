# Summary

Stop on pending Action recording

## Objective

stop before any following Action or transition when the actual terminal recorder returns recording_pending; preserve recording-only recovery.

## Details

- keep this repair bounded to its confirmed source contract. shared installed runtime, frozen candidates and historical Journals remain unchanged by fixture tests.
- preserve independent workers' edits; root owns Git, source pins and Release integration.

## Definition of Done

four structural pre-cutover failure cases prove no following mutation or replay; pending evidence remains available.

## Result

the structural receipt regression passes four injected pre-cutover terminal-append failures. no following mutation or effect replay occurs; the independent review accepts the common pending-receipt stop gate. actual full Release completion remains a separate unfinished gate.
