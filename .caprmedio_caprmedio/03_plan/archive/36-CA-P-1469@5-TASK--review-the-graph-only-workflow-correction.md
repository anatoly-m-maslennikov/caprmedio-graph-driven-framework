# Summary

Review the graph-only Workflow correction

## Objective

Independently review only O010v9/O011v12/O015v8 and Done P1465 against R1570v4/C425. Confirm graph ownership excludes repeated Step Action/input bindings; every original node, transition guard, destination and outcome remains unchanged, with valid Step endpoints. Preserve prior source-review evidence rather than repeating it. Own only this Plan; no source edits. You are not alone. Estimate <=8 minutes, one saved comparison/scenario check. No FPF, harvesting, code, Git or Journal.

## Details

### Independent graph-only correction review

First actual clock 2026-10-04 17:36:07 UTC is unchanged. I did not author P1465 or these Workflow corrections. Fully read this bound Plan, Done P1465v2, Active C425v1, R1570v4 and the three whole current/predecessor Workflows. Current successors are Active O010v9/O011v12/O015v8, all Updated At 2026-10-04 17:31:25 +0000. Current Goalv13, P1117v3 (2026-10-04 17:23:34 +0000), P1132v3 and relevant active P032v5/P033v9/R1490v1/E001v12 retain the actual revision/time of prior full reads; those unchanged reads are reused, not an invented fingerprint baseline.

Exact source root is `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/`. Predecessors are the matching whole filenames under `archive/` with the stated @Revision suffix.

| Whole compared source / predecessor | Node references and complete transition comparison |
| --- | --- |
| `CA-O-010-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--reconcile-sources.md`, v9 / @8 | CA-O-146–151, same six ordered nodes and entry146; all16 source-Step/condition/destination rows match after removing the source-cell Action labels. |
| `CA-O-011-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--bind-source-reconciliation-to-applicable-methodology.md`, v12 / @11 | CA-O-152–157, same six ordered nodes and entry152; all16 source-Step/condition/destination rows match after removing the source-cell Action labels. |
| `CA-O-015-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--maintain-project-structure.md`, v8 / @7 | CA-O-139–144, same six ordered nodes and entry139; all13 transition rows are byte-identical. |

Independent verdict: PASS for this graph-only correction against R1570v4. The node tables now contain only Step references. Per-Step Action/parameter/input columns, O011's accompanying role column, and transition source-cell Action IDs/labels are removed. Generic ownership/authority notes and nonbinding metadata references remain; none independently assigns a Step invocation. After exactly those removals and Version/Updated At normalization, each entire predecessor equals its current successor. Summary/identity/other metadata, typed ON_RESULT meaning, entries, all45 conditions/destinations/order, all18 nodes and every outside-table guard are therefore preserved, not inferred from the author's receipt.

Functional clause walkthrough:

| Bound graph route / negative case | Focused result |
| --- | --- |
| O010/O011 clean assessed frontier and complete current checks/valid approvals | Unchanged selection→assessment→publication route; still no publication with incomplete checks or unresolved conflicts. |
| O010/O011 exact decision, approved correction, requested revision, changed frontier or partial failure | Unchanged reselection/reassessment and expressly authorized bounded recovery routes; the whole confidence/authorization/revisit-budget guard survives, with no retry reset or invented approval. |
| O015 structural request and accepted resulting effects | Unchanged select→prepare→assess candidate→authorize exact/current effects→apply→assess result graph, with completion only after required checks and accepted effects are verified. |
| Failure/stale/ambiguous/unauthorized/below-threshold or unsupported outcome | All original stop/escalate/actual-state predicates remain. Removing duplicate bindings creates no success, dispatch, permission or retry bypass. |

The saved gate checks current endpoint identity/type/owning-Workflow metadata for all18 references without re-reviewing unchanged Step/Action semantics. Prior source reviews remain evidence; the separate Agentic Step-context correction/review belongs to the peer/root binding and is not accepted here. One initial endpoint helper used an incorrect guessed path and returned no file; it supplied no evidence or pass, and exact endpoint resolution uses discovered Carriers instead.

This focused result supplies root's independent C425 disposition: the duplicated Workflow bindings are removed with graph behavior preserved. Root owns Concern status/save and dependent admission. This is not runtime execution, Step-context acceptance, implementation/RMED acceptance, Run/Journal proof or whole-Epic closure. No new source finding is identified; only this Plan is written, with source/peer/parent/code/Git/Journal untouched.

The proportionate saved gate's first attempt stopped before pass because the helper incorrectly constructed CA-O010 rather than canonical CA-O-010; this was a diagnostic assertion error, not a source defect. The assertion was corrected without changing source or expanding scope; root received the actual failed-attempt notice. The same corrected gate passed/exit0 at 2026-10-04 17:40:37 UTC: seven strict saved carriers, exact bound current/prior sources, complete permitted-delta equality, all45 ordered condition/destination rows, all18 unique Active Step endpoints and owning-Workflow metadata, unchanged R1570/C425 bindings, Done P1465 and retained Plan identity/sections/whitespace/single EOF/BLOCKS. No unchanged Step/Action behavior was re-reviewed.

Physical Done at 2026-10-04 17:41:00 UTC, elapsed 293 seconds from unchanged first clock, within the eight-minute estimate. Objective/Summary/Version1 and P1132/P1158/P1160 BLOCKS remain unchanged; only this Plan moves to local done. Root owns the C425 disposition and separate Step-context/source/runtime gates.

### Definition of Done

Focused result, exact source revisions and saved proof are retained; findings remain explicit. Physical done/ placement denotes completion of this review only, not implementation acceptance.
