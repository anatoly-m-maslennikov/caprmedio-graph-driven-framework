# Summary

Review query MCP proof source semantics

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, Read the current query-specific MCP E2E test against accepted Tool and current Run-snapshot contracts. Identify concrete expected-result or continuation mistakes without executing image tests, fabricating evidence or broadening the audit.

## Details

One independently owned Task. No FPF, harvest, permission bypass, Source Atom or Journal changes, image proof claim or unrelated work. Preserve concurrent edits and ask below the selected 90% confidence threshold. Root records the result and commits validated owned changes.

## Definition of Done

Exact source-only findings or acceptance are recorded; no immutable-image functional pass is inferred.

## Result

Done: source-only review REJECTED candidate hash 5ff655f344c3bc79ee0ad517a5ba4ff86c97c91ed86f92868f228a090f2c4f33. fixture.snapshot excludes _projection, and the separate recording snapshot also omits it. A query that silently creates a Projection could pass the asserted no-effect checks. This is a test-proof gap, not evidence that the current query Tool writes a Projection.

The reviewer found no confirmed defect in selected results, retained continuations, the pre-own-event Journal snapshot or invalid/incomplete expectations. P1608 owns the missing query-specific Projection fingerprint. C449 still prevents actual immutable-image execution; no runtime acceptance follows.
