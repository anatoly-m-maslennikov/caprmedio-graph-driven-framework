# Summary

Accept corrected Artifact query Run boundary

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, independently accept or reject P1610's exact four-carrier source repair against the existing pure Tool and shared admitted Run boundaries. Preserve P1532's old acceptance; it cannot attest to revised source bytes.

## Details

Inputs: P1610's exact R1849@3/M330@3/D551@4/O158@3 paths and hashes, unchanged R1850@2/E569@2, CA-D-527–529 and current native Tool/query Action implementation. A different Agent reviews one Claim per carrier, no weakening of read-only/no-local-Journal behavior, explicit O158 input versions and preserved discovery binding. No source/code writes, environment change, runtime or image acceptance. P1527 may rebind only after this saved independent acceptance.

## Definition of Done

Save explicit ACCEPT or REJECT with exact source IDs/Versions/paths/hashes. Rejected review completion is not dispatch admission; no runtime or client-cache pass is inferred.

## Result

Done: independent review REJECTED source admission, not accepted execution. Exact reviewed bytes are R1849@3 f70123260870f72cefe7163f784826eca4131cf250915726e9bbdacee6e91759; M330@3 e68b0fb6cbee59c3d2e662648c8f33bb6bec3dbae58b40345b24d0620b813590; D551@4 292dd73b41e95b48d210d510275a456dddd5322b9b97cd666f52ff06bb8e4e78; O158@3 abe5ae697b49f9bd67c10261456fff398a97e0a6900d814aa4a06777b3f21e0f.

The three Tool carriers are internally consistent with the pure read-only Tool and shared admitted recording boundary. O158 still says its Artifact snapshot precedes actual Run recording, but execution starts Workflow/Step/Action Runs before the query Action captures that snapshot. This inherited ordering statement must be resolved before source acceptance. The current route/manifest retains the old P1532/O158@2 pins and rejects current O158@3 bytes; this is the anticipated pending-rebind gate, not an admission of revised source. P1532 remains unchanged. No runtime or image case was run. C451 preserves the unresolved source-order/admission remainder.
