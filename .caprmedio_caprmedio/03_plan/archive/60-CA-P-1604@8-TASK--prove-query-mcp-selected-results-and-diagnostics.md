# Summary

Prove query MCP selected results and diagnostics

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, Add and execute bounded query-specific current MCP tests for selected fields, heading fetch, allowed filters, stable pagination and truthful diagnostics, preserving actual shared recording and source non-mutation.

## Details

Use image sha256:057792974dc2d81f84f99dee5535a44d5ee30513b03f6154381d99aa0bd558cd, declared dependency groups workflow-orchestrator and rmed-workflow-mcp, and separate disposable Runtime Projects. No host Engine mount, assertion relaxation, live CLI or permission bypass. Other independent batches are separate Tasks; coverage counts only the assigned cases.

## Saved frontier

The host driver could not start: the repository virtual environment contains no Python executable. Provisioning the declared groups also failed on distribution-cache directory rename with EPERM in the existing and fresh permitted temporary cache. These attempts stopped. The bundled runtime lacks MCP, PyYAML and DBOS. No actual-image case ran; image tag was unchanged. CA-C-449 preserves the blocker. Prepared harness source does not count as execution or completion.

## Prepared source and verification

Saved test_selected_query_mcp_e2e.py, SHA256 5ff655f344c3bc79ee0ad517a5ba4ff86c97c91ed86f92868f228a090f2c4f33. It reuses the actual shared recorder and fresh MCP client and supplies four opt-in cases for W14/W15 selected fields, hierarchical headings, filters, stable pagination, snapshots and separate refusal diagnostics. No manual Journal or Run facts are inserted. Development-worker discovery passed one carrier check and intentionally skipped four actual-image cases. No runtime started; C449 still prevents functional execution, so this Task remains Active.

## Definition of Done

P1606 rejected the earlier source proof because source and recorder snapshots omitted Projections. P1608 repaired that blind spot and received independent source-only acceptance: current candidate SHA256 6475546d81cc4817f0d5bc356d038f22ab142594b4eb83ac9e56f938e6246663, 22529 bytes, 3 focused source tests passed and 4 image methods remain unrun. This supersedes the prepared 5ff655 candidate; the Task remains Active under C449.

The assigned current immutable-image cases have exact passing functional evidence, or remain unfinished with their precise protected blocker.
