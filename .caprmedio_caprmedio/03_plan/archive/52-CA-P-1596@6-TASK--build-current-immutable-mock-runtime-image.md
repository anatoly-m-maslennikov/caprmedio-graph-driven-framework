# Summary

Build current immutable mock runtime image

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, verify Docker runtime prerequisites and build the immutable current Engine image after the concurrent W13, fixture and harness source repairs are saved. Coordinate the ready signal; do not build stale candidates or mount host Engine code. Mock execution only; no denied carrier relocation retry or bypass.

## Details

This is one independently owned Epic Task. Preserve concurrent edits, use no FPF or harvesting, and ask the Operator below the selected 90% confidence threshold. Root records the Task result and commits related validated changes.

## Saved result

Built fresh immutable caprmedio-runtime image sha256:057792974dc2d81f84f99dee5535a44d5ee30513b03f6154381d99aa0bd558cd. Copied Engine context identity 811cfd014de92cc407cb1ae825d4054a30eb7407274d26b8098ae149bceed063 was unchanged before and after build. Direct image readback found Engine code at /workspace, ARM64 and the expected entrypoint; mock Compose has no host Engine mount. No services or actual image route tests started. This Task proves build identity only; C449 blocks later functional tests.

## Definition of Done

A fresh immutable image build is verified with exact candidate identity, or its precise prerequisite failure is recorded. Build success is not functional route acceptance.
