# Summary

Review the Agentic context binding slice 3

## Objective

After P1470 is physically Done, independently review only current v2 Steps CA-O-148, CA-O-149, CA-O-150, CA-O-151 against R1527v4/C426 and their v1 histories. Focus on the new binding: explicit supplied runtime context, exactly one Integrated/Isolated choice before Agentic dispatch, no fallback, missing/unsupported/unavailable blocks, Programmatic behavior unaffected. Verify every other clause/input/Action reference/Summary remains unchanged. Historical metadata may differ only by admitted archive Status/Updated At.

Own only this Plan. Do not repeat prior full source reviews or repair any source through review. You are not alone. Estimate <=6 minutes; exact scenario comparison and one saved check. No code, FPF, harvest, Git or Journal writes.

## Details

### Independent review result

PASS, with no findings in this bounded slice. Reviewed the whole current Active v2 carriers for O148/O149/O150/O151 and their whole Archived v1 carriers, P1470's physical Done carrier, R1527 Active v4, C426 Active v1, and the relevant P1117 v3 / P1119 v3 / P1132 v3 execution controls. The reviewer did not author these source changes. The exact comparison completed at 2026-10-04 17:57:29 UTC.

All eight source files are under `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/SOURCE_RECONCILIATION`; each current stem below has its whole prior revision at `archive/<same-stem>@1.md`. Both sets have admitted Updated At `2026-10-04 17:42:12 +0000`; the archived Status is explicitly Archived, not an original lifecycle-byte claim.

One bounded comparison emitted the whole-file unified difference for each pair, then compared the entire remaining text after removing only Status, Version, Updated At and the one old/new Agentic binding bullet. All four remaining texts compared exactly equal. The raw differences contain only Archived/Active Status, v1/v2 Version and the one binding bullet; Updated At is equal in these saved carriers. Every other metadata field, Summary, input clause, Action/Workflow identity, result/effect retention and approval/currentness/confidence/retry/escalation guard is unchanged. No source repair is required by this slice.

The replacement bullet in all four sources explicitly reads the admitted invocation's supplied `agentic_execution_context`, selects exactly one Integrated or Isolated context before actual Agentic Action dispatch, retains it with the Step Run, blocks invalid or unavailable context/capability, forbids defaults and silent substitution, grants no additional authority, and does not give Programmatic invocations an Agent context. This satisfies the narrowly bound R1527v4/C426 defect.

Clause cases, independently walked for each of the four identical new binding clauses:

| Invocation case | Required source outcome | Review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual Agentic Action; exactly one supplied Integrated value; required context/capability available | Bind Integrated before dispatch and retain it with the Step Run | PASS |
| Actual Agentic Action; exactly one supplied Isolated value; required context/capability available | Bind Isolated before dispatch and retain it with the Step Run | PASS |
| Actual Agentic Action; missing value | Block before dispatch, without default or substitution | PASS |
| Actual Agentic Action; ambiguous value, including both choices | Block before dispatch, without default or substitution | PASS |
| Actual Agentic Action; unsupported value | Block before dispatch, without default or substitution | PASS |
| Actual Agentic Action; required context or capability unavailable | Block before dispatch, without default or substitution | PASS |
| Actual Programmatic Action; no Agentic parameter supplied | Preserve existing input/dispatch behavior and acquire no Agent context | PASS |

These are source-clause comparisons, not executed Runs or runtime acceptance. No new issue or typed Concern was encountered. C426/source-stage acceptance, dependent Plan roll-up and runtime gates remain root-owned; this physical Done placement records only this completed independent review.

### Definition of Done

Focused independent result and source revisions are saved, with truthful findings/disposition. Physical Done placement denotes only completed review; root owns C426/source-stage acceptance.
