# Summary

Test suite reference-context binding

## Objective

Create mock and golden tests for exact current control closure and its capture/publication freshness proof.

## Details

Test missing, injected, unsafe, symlinked, stale-before-execution and changed-during-execution control rows; require the actual consumed references, not a matching digest alone. Expected bounded effort <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The owned work is independently accepted and its real verification result is saved. Source or mock proof alone does not close the actual Release gate.

## Results

Twelve reference-context tests pass, including every admitted root and a transitive pin mutated in both pre-/post-execution rederivation cases, descriptor-byte/mode races, path/closure refusals and unchanged shared reader globals. Two separate Suite Owner timing tests prove before-executor refusal and after-executor stale evidence. Saved in 689dd212f.
