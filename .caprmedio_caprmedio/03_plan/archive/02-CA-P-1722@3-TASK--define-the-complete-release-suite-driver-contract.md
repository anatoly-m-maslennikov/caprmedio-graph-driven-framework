# Summary

Define the complete Release suite driver contract

## Objective

Declare and independently review the complete Framework unittest discovery, immutable source-binding envelope, per-testcase JUnit evidence and fail-closed delivery boundary.

## Details

The revised R1886, M343, E586 and D579 were independently accepted by bootstrap_n_contract. The source includes every sealed Framework test_*.py carrier; no optional test exclusion or substitute focused suite is admitted. This source acceptance does not prove implementation or actual execution.

## Definition of Done

The four authoritative RMED Atoms are accepted and saved, with remaining production implementation work explicitly identified.
