# Summary

Author and review same-package image restoration

## Objective

Finish and independently review R1897, M353, E596, D591, O187 and the narrow D562 exception before code implementation. Admit both genuinely different and exactly reproduced immutable image IDs without rewriting historical proof.

## Details

The Operator explicitly approved rebuilding the missing selected image from verified retained N and registering its verified image digest. Preserve N's package, Version, public ca Skill, original proof and historical Journal. N21 remains unknown and is not replayed. No release gate is waived. Root owns Git, source admission and serialized runtime effects; independent workers own their assigned source scopes.

Work estimate: <=15 minutes; add a necessary remainder before expanding beyond this bound. Source RMED is reviewed before implementation. Test-first acceptance uses honest local doubles separately from actual Docker proof.

## Definition of Done

The exact saved source quartet/O and D562 revision/archive are independently accepted; source hashes are retained and the closed ABI, intent, outcome and same-ID branches agree.

## Results

The independent source/Plan review accepted the corrected same-ID and different-ID branches, closed eight-field intent, new shared lock, direct-Action separation and unchanged release gates, subject only to archive metadata repair. That repair is applied and mechanically verified: D562@2 differs from its original predecessor only in status Archived and archive-time updated_at. The original predecessor SHA is d6509c48567ec4627616597950d892fb6fba5f287f86dbff2e828b1578f5190b.
