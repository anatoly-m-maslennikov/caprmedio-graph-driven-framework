# Summary

Compose frozen Release Action phases

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, compose the accepted Release helpers behind the frozen selected Step/Action boundary.

## Details

After P1700/P1693, own only new RELEASE_VERSION/release_actions.py and tests/test_release_actions.py. Use the exact O164@2 ten Step/Action/phase pairs, strict D560 inputs and accepted helpers; phase comes only from private selected context, never client parameters. Validate the exact root, frozen parameters and Run/Step/Action identity. Keep typed retained phase results tied to the same candidate/Run, observe each actual helper result, stop on partial/failed/stale/unrecorded outcomes, and never fabricate Journal receipts. Preparation is effect-free; compile only the accepted child; staging never selects runtime; promotion uses full suite/image evidence. P1697 is safely pending when approved retention proof is unknown.

Use the existing shared execution Session for Run recording in the later provider integration; this private adapter must not create a second Journal writer. Durable recording-recovery/provider registration is separate required work; an interrupted/unknown private phase must not be implicitly replayed. Golden-first actual disposable pre-image helper effects and explicit mock image callbacks must distinguish mock proof from real Docker/image proof. Unknown phases, mismatched bindings, stale inputs and skipped prerequisites refuse with truthful effects. Preserve all other files and C447/C449 boundaries. If complete composition cannot fit the bound, save exact implemented phase frontier and a bounded required remainder.

## Definition of Done

Save exact API/hashes and focused completed phase/refusal tests, with unfinished provider/recording/image coverage explicit.

### Current bounded completion

All ten O164@2 phases are composed behind begin_release_action_run and execute_release_action. release_actions.py ff5be691be5ba01073ae667347ce078849e357d1c3d72aaf60c156ce31e22180 and tests05ff7f401888abb87cfeaa81ffa7bb14e783059004cf654ce334420316fed0df pass14 focused methods. The fresh actual disposable path runs the suite before O175 stages a package; mocked CLI image evidence and real disposable promotion lead to truthful pending retirement, not deletion. Exact root/request/Run/Step/Action/prerequisite and interruption refusal guards are covered. Shared provider/Session, durable Run/Action recording/recovery, live registration and actual image proof remain required. Observed elapsed time was15min24s,24s beyond the leaf estimate while adding the requested final fresh no-package case; no further scope was added. This timing deviation is recorded, not presented as exact <=15min execution.
