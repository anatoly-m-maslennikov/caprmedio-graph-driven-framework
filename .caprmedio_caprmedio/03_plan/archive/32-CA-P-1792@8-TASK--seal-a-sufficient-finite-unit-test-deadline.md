# Summary

Seal a sufficient finite Unit test deadline

## Objective

replace the code-only 900-second Unit ceiling with a finite source-defined settings deadline, preserving the full declared test set and all later Release gates.

## Details

- N10 completed source delivery and compilation, then timed out after 934.4613934169975 seconds. there is no complete JUnit report or validated outcome count; receipt executed_tests=0 is not proof that no tests ran.
- the Operator authorizes autonomous best-option selection with a Question for uncertainty. choose provisional default 3600 seconds and hard maximum 7200 seconds, not an unbounded execution or a verified sufficiency claim.
- separate lanes own RMED/settings, the captured-byte resolver/reference closure, suite/executor integration, regression tests and independent review. root owns pins, canonical guarded refresh, Git and fresh MCP dispatch.
- source default and Framework Instance values use the existing exact carriers and the one-key release_suite table. no new public override, CLI, environment, receipt or context schema is introduced; Candidate E2E settings and required modules remain unchanged.
- preserve failed N10 without replay and installed N unchanged. a fresh source-bound candidate must actually pass the complete Unit gate before later effects.

## Definition of Done

source/code have independent acceptance; default/fallback, finite-range, exact propagation, source-currentness, timeout-nonpass and unchanged partition tests pass; the fresh complete Unit gate passes with actual recorded evidence.
