# Summary

Align unsealed Step recording fixtures

## Objective

align the structural Step fixture with the actual fail-closed recording boundary before downstream Actions.

## Details

test_selected_step_inputs.py; an unrecorded terminal cannot permit cutover, finalization or invented success.

## Definition of Done

the confirmed defect is explained and repaired against current authority; source-equivalent focused regressions have a captured terminal result and independent review accepts the bounded change. actual full Release acceptance remains with the parent Plan.

## Acceptance evidence

independent acceptance passed the selected-step and historical host-isolation modules together: 8 tests, 5.975 seconds, exit 0, using host-tests Python. unsealed O143 recording stops at its exact emitted prefix; O144 is absent, not falsely completed or dispatched.

this is bounded fixture acceptance only; the complete fresh Release gate remains with CA-P-1809 and CA-P-1117.
