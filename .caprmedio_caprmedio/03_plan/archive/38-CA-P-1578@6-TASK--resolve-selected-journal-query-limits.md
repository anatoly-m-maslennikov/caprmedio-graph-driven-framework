# Summary

Resolve selected Journal query limits

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, resolve W15's unresolved-limit failure using governed defaults rather than invented values.

## Details

- Own only the query Action adapter and native Journal query Tool/tests if a genuine implementation defect is confirmed. Source authority, golden fixture, strict route proof, shared executor, MCP, Journal and Plans belong to others.
- Reopen current R1850 and complete required query limits. An incomplete settings carrier must remain invalid; never turn unresolved-limit into a happy outcome.
- If the disposable default-settings carrier is empty, send its precise source-owned query table requirement to P1567. Do not edit production when the Tool correctly enforces its contract.
- Apply patch, preserve concurrent edits, no commits, FPF, harvesting or live effects. Inherit 90%.
- Actual diagnosis: no Tool or adapter defect. The disposable framework default-settings TOML was empty; R1850 requires eleven positive query limits. W15 correctly returned invalid/unresolved-limit. The fixture owner P1567 must copy the governed query table from CORE_META_MODEL/caprmedio_framework_default_settings.toml. No production changes or invented defaults were made; actual repaired W15 execution remains P1567's gate.

## Definition of Done

A true query defect is repaired or the exact governed fixture prerequisite is reported; native truthful coverage is preserved.
