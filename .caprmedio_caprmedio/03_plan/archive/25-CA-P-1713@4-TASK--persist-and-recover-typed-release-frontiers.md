# Summary

Persist and recover typed Release frontiers

## Objective

Implement D574's typed Release checkpoint and exact same-Run recording recovery using the existing shared writer, with bounded independent subagents and truthful unfinished verification gates.

## Details

1. encode and restore complete typed private Release state, including preflight, without reconstructing authority from current unrelated state or storing callables.
2. integrate intent, checkpoint and recording continuation in the existing selected provider/executor; the canonical Work Journal remains the sole Run recorder.
3. reconstruct only proven started/terminal Runs; continue at an untouched phase only after currentness and permission revalidation. Unknown effects stop for reconciliation, not replay.
4. cover restart before effect, after effect before recording, after durable recording, terminal retry and tampered/stale evidence. Preserve every original fifteen-route contract.
5. run pure tests now; fixture, actual Journal, image and MCP acceptance remain pending while C449's cleanup restriction persists. No suppressed teardown or permission bypass.

## Definition of Done

The exact same admitted Workflow Run can recover pending recording or continue proven completed phases after restart without duplicate effects or Journal facts; closed checkpoint validation and all required restart/refusal scenarios have passing source-current evidence. Static or pure codec tests alone do not complete this Task.
