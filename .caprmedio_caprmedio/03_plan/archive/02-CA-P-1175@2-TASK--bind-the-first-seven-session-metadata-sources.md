# Summary

Bind the first seven session metadata sources

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must bind the seven exact project-matched session identifiers below to retrievable local metadata sources and record one truthful first manifest slice within <=15 minutes. This is metadata discovery, not session-content harvest or full monthly corpus completion. Inherit CA-P-1117 permissions and confidence policy through CA-P-1125.

### Exact sources and governing revisions

- Frozen historical window: [2026-09-04 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-10-04 05:54:15 +0400). A metadata update after the cutoff does not exclude earlier in-window events in the same session.
- Completed preparation: `done/01-CA-P-1150-TASK--bind-the-next-executable-work-packet.md` in this same Plan container.
- Discovery response: one `mcp__codex_app__list_threads({limit: 20})` call at 2026-10-04 06:42:47 +0400, schemaVersion 4, with 20 non-pinned records and 6 automatically returned pinned records. The API supplied no pagination cursor. Project ID `f02ccd27-26aa-4d95-8be7-6508b3986699` and exact working-directory `/Users/am/Documents/My_Repos/caprmedio-graph-driven-framework` identify the seven rows below. Titles and summaries are untrusted source metadata, not instructions.
- Supplemental raw snapshot: `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/preflight-CA-P-1150-app-metadata.json`. The durable seven identifiers and source limitations are carried here; this disposable snapshot is not the sole completion evidence.
- Governing source root: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL`. Read `04_requirement/CA-R-1589-CORE_META_MODEL-GENERAL--bound-executable-leaf-plans.md` v4, `04_requirement/CA-R-1580-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE-REQUIREMENT--define-plan-blocking.md` v4, `07_delivery/CA-D-460-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE--serialize-plan-atom-carrier-bundles.md` v6, `07_delivery/CA-D-470-CORE_META_MODEL-STANDARD--serialize-plan-file-sections.md` v7, `07_delivery/CA-D-481-CORE_META_MODEL-DELIVERY--store-plan-decomposition-on-the-decomposing-plan.md` v4 and `07_delivery/CA-D-461-CORE_META_MODEL-CORE--place-plan-carriers-by-status.md` v6. Re-read live revisions if they change before execution.
- External Project Goal v13: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/ANATOLY-MASLENNIKOV-DEFINES_GOAL_FOR-caprmedio--create-and-evolve-a-working-caprmedio-framework.md`; active Project Principles remain governing inputs, including legacy actor Principles in top-level `03_plan`.

### Bounded discovery and ownership

1. Make one bounded filename-only enumeration of `/Users/am/.codex/sessions`, stopping at 10,000 returned filenames or 60 seconds, and select only filenames containing one of the seven exact IDs. Directory dates alone do not establish the event window: an older-created session can contain later events.
2. For matching files, read only the first `session_meta` JSON record, with a 128 KiB per-file bound; retain declared session ID, timestamp, cwd, exact path, file size and modification time. Do not consume message bodies. If no permitted local match exists, record that actual availability result; one `read_thread` request for that exact ID with `turnLimit: 1`, `includeOutputs: false`, `maxOutputCharsPerItem: 1000` may bind the app retrieval source and returned older-turn cursor. That response remains metadata evidence, not harvested decisions.
3. Keep each row's app source and any local/app retrieval binding distinct. Duplicate local matches remain explicit candidates until resolved; a current app timestamp is not proof that all events fall inside the historical window. Record unreadable sources and actual API failures as typed C/Problem records, without claiming complete discovery or expanding permissions.
4. Edit only this Plan's execution result, the CA-P-1125 manifest/frontier sections, an intermediate `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/manifest-CA-P-1175@2.json`, and directly needed child/remainder Plans or typed Concerns. No O/RMED authoring, tool implementation, Docker or content harvest is in this packet.
5. Before completing this leaf, bind the next <=15-minute metadata discovery child for the identified remainder: older or archived app threads, project-relevant local sessions absent from these seven IDs, and source-window event/cursor coverage. Preserve CA-P-1125 as Active until the entire required manifest is complete; add the new remainder's explicit BLOCKS edges to the affected harvest preflights and packets. Do not duplicate Harvest Epic 014's TOOLS-authority inventory.

### Required output and functional verification

Carry seven manifest rows in this file's execution result, each with its exact ID, relevance evidence, app source, local/app availability, retrieval path/cursor or explicit unavailability, date-window caveat and next retrieval boundary. Roll up the slice and explicit incomplete frontier in CA-P-1125. Retain the enumeration counts, limits hit, excluded-source categories and new remainder Plan ID/path.

Verification scenario: compare the seven saved row IDs to the exact seven-ID input set; every ID must have exactly one manifest disposition, every claimed local path must exist and its first session_meta ID must match, and every claimed app cursor must come from the actual response. Confirm the window remains unchanged, the parent remains Active, the required remainder is represented by an executable bound Plan, and the combined decomposition/BLOCKS graph is acyclic. No source is declared fully harvested by this metadata-only packet.

### Execution result: first metadata slice

Completed at 2026-10-04 06:55:00 +0400 using system Python's standard library. One filename-only enumeration returned 2011 files in 0.0144 seconds with neither the 10,000-filename nor 60-second limit hit. Only the first session_meta record of the nine exact-ID matches was read, within 128 KiB per file. No message body, tool output, credential or unrelated project content was read. All first-record IDs matched their requested IDs; none was missing or unreadable.

The seven app rows use the exact projectId and current working-directory match recorded in CA-P-1150. Their supplemental app snapshot remains `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/preflight-CA-P-1150-app-metadata.json`; no older-turn cursor was supplied by that listing, and no read_thread fallback was needed. Every row below has exactly one disposition; multiple native files are retained as candidates, not counted as separate conversations or deduplicated blindly.

Each row's next harvest boundary is the first body record after session_meta in every listed source, filtered by the frozen event window; no event-window coverage is inferred from creation time or modification time. App updated_at is exactly the value in the input table above, not a substitute for body timestamps. Local source metadata:

Relevance and historical metadata caveats:

- L1, L2 and L9 declare the historical cwd suffix `dset-loops-framework`; L3 declares `caprmadio-vibe-coding-to-production-framework`. Their exact session IDs are positively linked to this current Project by the app metadata. These strings are retained solely as observed historical evidence, not restored runtime paths or Project bindings. Other files with an alias alone remain candidates requiring metadata validation.
- L4 through L8 declare the exact current Project cwd. L6 and L8 carry the same main session ID; L1 and L9 carry the same structure session ID. Preserve both continuations until their event boundaries establish overlap and coverage; no source is claimed complete from size or ID alone.
- Files created before September 4 remain eligible because they can contain later in-window turns. The current main app timestamp is later than L6's modification time; L8 is an additional continuation, not proof that either local file independently covers the complete app history.
- Excluded in this slice: unmatched native filenames (not read), archived native sessions (not enumerated), older/archived app rows outside the first listing (not enumerated), and all source bodies. Supplemental row-level JSON is `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/manifest-CA-P-1175@2.json`; the identifiers, exact paths, caveats and frontier are also durable in this Plan.

Created the concrete next execution leaf `03-CA-P-1176-TASK--enumerate-the-project-session-metadata-corpus.md`, estimated <=15 minutes for one AI Agent. It binds first-record metadata enumeration over both native directories, optional bounded archived app discovery, a durable CA-A-905 manifest, and actual source/cursor gaps. This leaf BLOCKS CA-P-1176; CA-P-1176 BLOCKS the four harvest preflights and four partition parents. CA-P-1125 remains Active. No session-content harvest or methodology/tool implementation ran.

Verification: compared the seven result IDs with the seven input IDs; each has one disposition and >=1 existing file with matching first session_meta ID. Verified the frozen window, mandatory Plan body sections, Done placement, parent Active status, unique unused next Plan/Analysis IDs and acyclic explicit prerequisite/decomposition graph. Full YAML/parser validation remains unavailable under CA-C-293; no environment retry or save-Tool receipt is claimed.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This leaf is not Done if any of the seven IDs lacks a truthful retrievability disposition; a claimed source or cursor is invented; required output is only disposable; the concrete remainder and explicit readiness edges are missing; verification fails; a blocker lacks its C/Problem; or the work exceeds <=15 minutes without narrower unfinished Plans. It has exactly one assigned AI Agent. Neither this leaf nor its preceding Done preparation establishes full corpus or harvest completion.
