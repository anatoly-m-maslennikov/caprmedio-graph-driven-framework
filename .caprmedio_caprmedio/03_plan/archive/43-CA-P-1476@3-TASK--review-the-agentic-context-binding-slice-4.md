# Summary

Review the Agentic context binding slice 4

## Objective

After P1470 is physically Done, independently review only current v2 Steps CA-O-152, CA-O-153, CA-O-154, CA-O-155 against R1527v4/C426 and their v1 histories. Focus on the new binding: explicit supplied runtime context, exactly one Integrated/Isolated choice before Agentic dispatch, no fallback, missing/unsupported/unavailable blocks, Programmatic behavior unaffected. Verify every other clause/input/Action reference/Summary remains unchanged. Historical metadata may differ only by admitted archive Status/Updated At.

Own only this Plan. Do not repeat prior full source reviews or repair any source through review. You are not alone. Estimate <=6 minutes; exact scenario comparison and one saved check. No code, FPF, harvest, Git or Journal writes.

## Details

### Focused independent review result

PASS for O152/O153/O154/O155 v2, reviewed independently after P1470 was observed physically in `done` with status Done. Review completed 2026-10-04 17:59:11 UTC within the <=6-minute packet. This result accepts only this four-Step source delta; C426 and overall source/runtime acceptance remain root-owned.

Governing inputs directly read: current P1117 v3 execution controls, P1132 v3, completed P1470 v1, C426 v1, authoritative R1527 v4; live Operator Goal v13 and Project Principles R1407 v5, R1420 v5, R1421 v4, R1423 v4, R1490 v1 and R819 v13. The reusable Step definitions remain in CORE_META_MODEL. No source repair or broader source review was performed.

All eight complete Step carriers were read. Exact source directory: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY_COMPILATION`. Each current file below is Active v2 and its whole `archive/<same-stem>@1.md` carrier is Archived v1. Their Updated At is `2026-10-04 17:42:12 +0000`; archived lifecycle metadata is admitted, not an original-byte claim.

| Step | Exact current basename | Unchanged Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O152 | `CA-O-152-CORE_META_MODEL-STEP--select-the-applicable-methodology-sources.md` | O004 |
| O153 | `CA-O-153-CORE_META_MODEL-STEP--assess-applicable-methodology-source-conflicts.md` | O005 |
| O154 | `CA-O-154-CORE_META_MODEL-STEP--propose-applicable-methodology-source-corrections.md` | O006 |
| O155 | `CA-O-155-CORE_META_MODEL-STEP--obtain-the-applicable-methodology-correction-decision.md` | O007 |

One saved diff/case gate passed: remove only the added `### Agentic invocation binding` subsection from each current carrier; normalize only Status, Version and Updated At in each current/archive pair; compare the complete remaining texts using `diff -u`. All four comparisons exited successfully with no differences. Direct reading confirms the exact P1470 paragraph is the sole semantic addition. IDs, Summaries, all input clauses, Action references, relations, source-selection coverage, deterministic conflict/frontier guards, correction boundaries and exact Operator approval/Journal constraints are unchanged. No Project-specific implementation detail is introduced.

SHA-256 bindings for that saved gate:

| Step | Current v2 | Whole archived v1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O152 | `a0b02c29350738ef1cfa1a20125af3c29bf707b319de60d5744de1dfb53807fc` | `1a4049543e2c59fc50465d7f16b3d4aad914074e416cf69fd9270ae524c96379` |
| O153 | `7135b2a6558ea556f3182b538e03cdadd759556d9f4b14546d18db6e3ca87d87` | `d3dfa7db3ffafdc00cf6299060b028aa57743012617683bbc9037627cde0f2d3` |
| O154 | `d370b3199af136e9879cde148e1f13aeab0512e3f3af82fef7b5314c1407e3ad` | `5da1246a799c4583507432f9da4c74a9782c938dd1f1acf302e419b6ec5c5013` |
| O155 | `895f31fddd18894449f73321bf1fe3a26e4686a2a474a87ad0c2475812fadc12` | `42a7e0cccddb7312e6d6371cb0b15a677e0890a9544f5d49ec151d919bbe3cd0` |

The exact same paragraph in all four Steps passes these source-contract cases against R1527 v4:

| Actual invocation and supplied context | Required source result |
| --- | --- |
| Agentic; exactly one Integrated; context/capability available | Bind Integrated from the admitted invocation's supplied `agentic_execution_context` before dispatch; retain it with the Step Run. |
| Agentic; exactly one Isolated; context/capability available | Bind Isolated from that same explicit runtime parameter before dispatch; retain it with the Step Run. |
| Agentic; missing runtime value | Block the invocation; no default or substitution. |
| Agentic; unsupported runtime value | Block the invocation; no default or substitution. |
| Agentic; ambiguous value, including both contexts | Block the invocation; `=1` is not resolved. |
| Agentic; selected context or required capability unavailable | Block the invocation; no fallback to the other context. |
| Programmatic; parameter absent or present | This binding creates no Agent context and does not require the parameter; existing Action identity, inputs and behavior remain governed by the unchanged definition. |

For both Agentic choices the paragraph grants no additional authority. O155's actual Operator approval requirement remains independent and exact. These are clause/dispatch-admission cases, not executed runtime Runs or runtime acceptance. No blocking finding or unresolved choice was found in this slice; no additional Concern or repair leaf is warranted. The P1132/P1158/P1160 BLOCKS edges remain. Root must use this result with the other bounded reviews when reassessing C426 and dependent specification gates; this Plan does not close them.

### Definition of Done

Focused independent result and source revisions are saved, with truthful findings/disposition. Physical Done placement denotes only completed review; root owns C426/source-stage acceptance.
