# Summary

Isolate suite child temporaries and imports

## Objective

Isolate suite child temporaries and imports under the parent's exact source contract.

## Details

suite_driver_repair exclusively owns RELEASE_VERSION/run_release_suite.py and tests/test_run_release_suite.py.

Estimated execution slice <=15 minutes. Preserve other workers' changes. Root alone owns index, commits and actual shared runtime effects. Tests and disposable smoke evidence are not release promotion.

## Definition of Done

Fixed child scratch and same-name flat-module import regressions pass without candidate-byte changes.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this exclusive bounded assignment as the minimal current parent repair. Preserve installed N and truthful observed effects.

## Recorded verification

8b8d74bb5; sixteen driver tests passed, including fixed scratch and same-name local import isolation. Root's combined executor/driver command passed 27 cases.
