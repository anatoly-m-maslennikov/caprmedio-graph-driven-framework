# Summary

Repair candidate E2E binding fixtures

## Objective

Repair candidate E2E binding fixtures under the parent's exact source contract.

## Details

release_fixture_repair exclusively owns RELEASE_VERSION/tests/test_release_suite_bindings_handoff.py.

Estimated execution slice <=15 minutes. Preserve other workers' changes. Root alone owns index, commits and actual shared runtime effects. Tests and disposable smoke evidence are not release promotion.

## Definition of Done

The exact three source-pinned harness fixtures and neighboring phase cases pass without weakening production admission.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this exclusive bounded assignment as the minimal current parent repair. Preserve installed N and truthful observed effects.

## Recorded verification

782afb531; five handoff fixture cases and twelve neighboring phase cases passed without changes to production admission.
