# Summary

Bind Scope Unit creation

## Objective

Scope Unit creation implements the current admitted logical Scope Unit contracts.

## Details

Estimated own work: 15 minutes. Assignee: AI Agent. Split concrete work larger than this bound into actual bounded children before execution. This Backlog Task is current pending work, not a future-Version Scope or authorization to execute now.

Bind CA-O-203 with existing applicable creation rules and configuration authority. Require explicit logical identity/parent, valid declarations/schema, expected absence and actual state/effects. Keep physical backend details private and preserve unrelated Scope Units/configuration; do not infer runtime delivery or a database build.

Start only after CA-P-2251's actual accepted FPF review and independently accepted applicable current contracts, not a Plan-validation result or historical pins. Bind actual contract/API/code pins and permissions. Require separately accepted applicable Core alignment under CA-P-1970 where rules conflict; no Core/content work is included here. Source authoring or this pending Task grants no runtime/live authority.

Deliver the exact changed or reviewed manifest and focused check results to the independent integration/verification owner. Preserve historical receipts. No database build, new transport, Atom deletion, automatic batch retry/resume or publication-concurrency mechanism is included.

### Definition of Done

The Plan is **not** Done if applicable accepted contracts/FPF gates or current pins are missing; focused valid, refusal and no-op/error/effect checks fail or lack actual results; unrelated behavior regresses; implementation is claimed from preparation; or deferred/unauthorized capability is enabled. Own work must not exceed 15 minutes without prior decomposition.
