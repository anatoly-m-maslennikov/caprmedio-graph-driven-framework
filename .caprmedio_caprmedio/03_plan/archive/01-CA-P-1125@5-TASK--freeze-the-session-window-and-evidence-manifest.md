# Summary

Freeze the session window and evidence manifest

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for freeze the session window and evidence manifest, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Use the request window [2026-09-04 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-10-04 05:54:15 +0400). Read the current Operator Goal and all active Project Principles before discovery. Inspect project-linked session metadata through available local/app read interfaces; do not scan denied paths, credentials, or unrelated project content. Compare existing Harvest Epic 014 and other active Plans for overlapping ownership.

### Required output

A timestamped corpus manifest with session identifiers, relevance reasons, retrieval sources/cursors, known gaps, date partitions, current authority revisions, and reusable existing work. If enumeration exceeds fifteen minutes, create additional bounded manifest subtasks before declaring the harvest stage complete.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

### Preparation result and remaining manifest frontier

CA-P-1150 completed bounded preparation at 2026-10-04 06:42:47 +0400. One app listing with limit 20 returned 20 recent records and 6 pinned overflow records; 7 exact project-linked Codex IDs are durably carried in the new child `02-CA-P-1175-TASK--bind-the-first-seven-session-metadata-sources.md`. No pagination cursor was supplied, and app updated_at does not enumerate in-window events. No session content was harvested.

CA-P-1175 completed the first metadata binding: all seven exact app session IDs have local sources, represented by nine continuation candidates. One filename-only enumeration returned 2,011 files with no limit reached; only the first session_meta record of the nine matches was read. Its durable result and exact paths are retained in `done/02-CA-P-1175-TASK--bind-the-first-seven-session-metadata-sources.md`; supplemental JSON is `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/manifest-CA-P-1175.json`. Duplicate continuations and verified historical cwd values remain evidence, not restored Project bindings or proof of complete source history.

CA-P-1176 completed the substantive native metadata corpus enumeration. Its result is retained in this matching bundle's `done/03-CA-P-1176-TASK--enumerate-the-project-session-metadata-corpus.md`. The durable CA-A-905 Analysis is the complete metadata source for both verified native roots; event-window body coverage is an explicit later harvest frontier, not a fabricated metadata gap. All three immediate children (CA-P-1150, CA-P-1175, CA-P-1176) are Done; this parent may close without claiming that any partition was harvested.

Existing Harvest Epic 014 is a TOOLS-authority harvest: CA-P-1073 inventories reusable operations from the TOOLS RMEDO subtree, not the monthly session corpus. Reuse and cross-map its candidates in later reconciliation rather than duplicating that inventory. No monthly completion evidence is inferred from it. General adopted Operations route to CORE_META_MODEL and caprmedio-specific Operations to PROJECT_CONFIGURATION under CA-P-1117; this metadata packet authors neither.

CA-C-293 records the actual Project Python/environment verification failure. The saved Plan structure and prerequisite graph were checked with system Python's standard library; full YAML/parser validation was not run. This has a truthful nonblocking preparation disposition and does not authorize environment repair or bypass a later functional gate.

### Completed corpus output

Completed at 2026-10-04 07:05:00 +0400. CA-A-905 at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-905-ANALYSIS_RPRT--inventory-the-session-evidence-corpus.md` v1 durably retains the frozen window, full1659-file/1657-ID relevant/candidate metadata manifest, two continuation pairs, source kinds, exact repository/parent relevance, observed counts/bounds, availability and body/cursor frontiers. Supplemental JSON: `.caprmedio_tmp/CA-P-1117/manifest-CA-P-1176.json`. Native snapshot:2045 files (2010 active,35 archived),0 malformed/unreadable first records,386 unrelated metadata rows excluded without body access; no discovery limit reached.

CA-C-294 preserves one historical source as a cautious candidate. Under the Epic90% safe-choice policy its exact identity check belongs to the first bounded harvest packet, not another unbound metadata preflight. The candidate is neither silently excluded nor claimed fully relevant/harvested. All four partition parents and preflights are reviewed and bind CA-A-905 with this condition and explicit event/continuation frontiers. No actual metadata-discovery remainder or app cursor remains; no optional archived app call was needed to retrieve the known IDs.

Harvest Epic014 remains the owner of existing TOOLS-authority inventory; reuse it at reconciliation. All harvest partitions and downstream methodology/implementation/Docker/closure stages remain unfinished. Root's prior parser check plus this leaf's saved-manifest/ID/headings/graph verification are recorded in CA-P-1176; local environment limitation CA-C-293 is not claimed repaired. No independent save-Tool receipt or Journal completion is invented.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
