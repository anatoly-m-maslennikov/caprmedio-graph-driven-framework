# Summary

Review the corrected reversal outcomes

## Objective

Independently review O131 v2 only, against P1450 F1, Done P1461 and C424. Confirm failed and partial_failure are disjoint for known-zero, uncertain-zero, and confirmed partial effects; verify other guards remain unchanged. Own only this Plan. No source repairs. Record exact saved evidence, findings and completion; if passed, it supplies the C424 disposition. Estimate <=8 minutes.

Use current CA-P-1117 v3 and relevant active Principles. Own only stated files; you are not alone, preserve others' edits. No harvesting, FPF, code, Journal or Git writes. Record actual clock and result. A saved source is not runtime proof.

## Details

### Independent focused reversal review

First actual clock 2026-10-04 17:25:17 UTC is unchanged. Fully read this binding, current Active O131v2 (Updated At 2026-10-04 17:10:04 +0000), Done P1461v1, Done P1450v1/F1 and root-owned C424v1. I did not author the reversal source or its correction. P1117v3 was reopened completely because its actual Updated At changed to 2026-10-04 17:23:34 +0000; its thirteen-Workflow scope, review gate and source/runtime distinction govern. Previously full Goalv13, active P032v5/P033v9/R1490v1/E001v12 and R1519v5/E489v5 reads were qualified by their unchanged actual revision/time; no invented hash baseline or repeated broad audit is used.

Exact reviewed source: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/CA-O-131-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--apply-an-approved-reversal.md`. The only changed substantive clauses are Outcomes lines42–43.

| Bound failure case | Independent outcome selection and retained evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Established zero applied effects and zero uncertain completion | failed only: line42 requires both facts and evidence establishing them; line43 has neither an established applied effect nor uncertainty. |
| First-effect timeout, zero confirmed applied effects, any uncertain completion | partial_failure only: line43 explicitly includes any uncertain completion even with zero confirmed effects; line42's zero-uncertainty condition is false. |
| At least one established applied effect followed by failure | partial_failure only: line43's >=1 condition holds; line42's zero-applied condition is false, whether or not uncertainty also exists. |

Independent verdict: PASS for this exact correction. The three predicates are disjoint for the bound cases; unknown effect completion is not mislabeled absent. Partial_failure still retains completed/failed/unattempted/uncertain effects and the exact remaining boundary. This resolves P1450 F1's uncertain-first-effect counterexample without a classifier precedence invented by the executor.

Compared the complete current source with the actual full v1 text retained from my P1450 read, allowing only Version/Updated At and these two failure rows: every other byte is equal. Thus Summary/identity/relations and approval, currentness, no-op, history/reference, cancellation, Journal/every-Run, safe-boundary and no-replay guards remain unchanged. P1461's receipt identifies the preserved prior v1 carrier and unchanged O130/O132; this focused review does not reopen or reaccept those other sources.

C424 disposition supplied to root: its exact overlap is corrected and independently passes; root alone owns Concern status/save and dependent admission. No additional source finding is identified in this packet. This is a source-classification review, not reversal execution, runtime/Tool availability, Run/Journal proof, whole-Epic acceptance or shared Concern closure. Required runtime/specification and other source gates remain.

One proportionate saved check passed/exit0 at 2026-10-04 17:29:52 UTC: three strict carriers, exact current source binding, full v1 preservation outside the two failure rows/revision/time, registered Plan sections/identity/whitespace/single EOF, Done P1461 and retained P1132/P1158/P1160 BLOCKS. The table above is the functional clause walkthrough, not an executed reversal. Physical Done at 2026-10-04 17:30:01 UTC, elapsed 284 seconds from unchanged first clock, within the eight-minute estimate. Only this Plan is edited/moved; Objective, Summary and Version1 are unchanged, and source/parent/peer/Concern/code/Git/Journal bytes are not edited. Root owns the supported C424 disposition and downstream gates.

### Definition of Done

The exact bound work and one proportionate saved-file/scenario check are complete. Findings and remaining independent review stay explicit; a completed review may report findings without claiming clean source acceptance. Place this Plan in done/ only when its own work is complete.
