# Summary

Review full Framework staging boundary

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, review full Framework staging boundary.

## Details

Read-only release_packaging.py and dedicated golden tests versus accepted D562/R1877/R1879/E572/E573. Focus complete Engine/Methodology/full ca resources, manifest digest vs claimed sha, existing-release idempotency/collision, path/symlink/race controls and unchanged N/selector/public Skill/source/settings/Journals. No broad audit or actual staging/installation/image effect; concrete gaps or pure helper acceptance only.

Read the accepted parent source pins and current worktree before changes. Respect external file ownership, C447 denied relocation and C449 host/image gate; the existing development worker is not new immutable-image proof.

## Definition of Done

Save bounded output/current exact evidence and truthful remaining coverage. Partial source/helper/mock acceptance does not complete the parent or Epic.

## Result

Independent /root/centralize_projection_carriers REJECT the initial staging helper5c124c6c99aec92ff2e44c422ae69236731916ff0eeeea1ba1b07129dcab5c09 and tests57a1c82d215866515ba58e465ef8aa6ca4f1231f434ff21cbf26bc2f679a91b5. Findings: raw caller SHA/package rows are trusted, complete typed inventory is not enforced, caller mode overrides observed source mode, and a symlinked runtime staging parent can escape. Review work is complete but rejected code is not accepted; P1654 and its package-hardening child own required repair and re-review.
