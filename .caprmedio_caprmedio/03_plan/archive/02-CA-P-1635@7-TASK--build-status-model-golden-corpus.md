# Summary

Build status model golden corpus

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, build status model golden corpus.

## Details

New tests/test_authoritative_status_models.py and tests/fixtures/status_models/ only. Start with fixtures covering all declared roles, specialized Type precedence, fallback, exact casing, missing/ambiguous/stale/forged authority and caller whitelist rejection. Coordinate with P1634 API; preserve existing external tests.

Inputs: accepted CA-P-1633 source packet and current saved lifecycle inputs; current default role domains, R1825@3/E545@2 and D565@1. Host/image gates C449 and relocation gate C447 remain unchanged. The existing development worker can run focused development tests, not immutable-image proof.

## Definition of Done

Good fixtures pass and deliberate errors report correct refusal. Focused development-worker results are distinct from immutable-image proof.

## Result

The golden corpus first exposed specialized-model selection and configured-source defects; those were repaired in the separately owned helper. Final test SHA-256 68505e4ac15a0694eee069d39886571290d58f743ac69a685ea21fcc8f638407. Eleven focused tests passed in the existing development worker, covering all role domains, Type precedence/fallback, casing/pins/forgery, configured roots, duplicate YAML, positive integer versions, definition roles and duplicate body domains. Development-worker evidence only, not new image proof.
