# Summary

Reconcile the exact Git-backed binding state

## Objective

record the Operator-approved, exact current Git-backed binding observation through independently reviewed source-first support, preserving all historical event and Manifest bytes, so guarded refresh can proceed truthfully.

## Details

- root owns source, integration, exact authorization and actual observation; independent bounded worker slices own the private observer, regression fixtures and read-only review. estimated implementation/verification slice <=15 minutes.
- R1893/M349/E592/D587 define this distinct support operation. use an existing-schema recovered state at the next positive carrier-history revision with an exact predecessor witness, not a fabricated completed historical change.
- the first refresh was blocked before a write; its latest canonical carrier record v2 hashes to `1eabfd2f1a0df45ae0df2ff4b2221ebe557ef1f520a990ef6d10f542259d6723`, while the exact current Git HEAD blob hashes to `e58209ebdfa598e7ed30b87abeac43606ab3fec35238c99870ea1a01a5a62946`.
- revalidate exact Git/current bytes, target history and absence of pending publication under the same carrier lock. refuse dirty, changed or conflicting evidence; never rewrite the Manifest or old Journal rows.
- preserve a sealed observation for recording-only retry. actual observation and later actual refresh are distinct recorded effects; neither proves full release acceptance.

## Definition of Done

### Observed result

source and implementation were independently accepted; seven reconciliation cases plus five refresh and sixteen lifecycle cases pass. the approved observation was appended once at 2026-10-06T15:20:21+04:00 as `release-manifest-reconciliation:99232777f00d64d09e48155c3aefd1fe3b35c94678a16dd64d99a9b5c6daef59`, recovered carrier revision 3. it witnesses Git HEAD `7a15f736b5def924716978f102516c099eabbe2c`, blob `9ccfab16d4d79ac67e15ea886f10fc440f82a888`, exact existing raw digest `e58209ebdfa598e7ed30b87abeac43606ab3fec35238c99870ea1a01a5a62946`, and the original revision-2 predecessor. historical Journal prefixes, Manifest bytes and installed N's selector stayed unchanged. no observation recording is pending. CA-P-1780 then completed the separately authorized actual refresh.

source and implementation have independent acceptance and focused fixture proof; the actual observed state is appended exactly once with verified Git/current/predecessor evidence and no unresolved pending recording; old Journal bytes, the Manifest and installed N are unchanged. CA-P-1780 then owns the fresh authorized admission refresh.

## Pre-execution review

the Operator explicitly approved source-first reconciliation of the current Git-backed state and continuation. independent source review accepts the existing recovered-state schema with D587's exact local witness, avoiding a generic Journal schema extension or attribution of historical writes.
