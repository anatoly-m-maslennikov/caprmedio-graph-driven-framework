# Summary

Review deterministic Release child manifest

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, review deterministic Release child manifest.

## Details

Read-only independent review of P1668's exact D571/C454 source against D561/D566/D567/E572 and current compiler rendering. Verify deterministic serialization and output rows, no expected-output/self-checksum cycle, current source/copy/frontier/compiler pins, child-only delivery and actual-success evidence. Do not add a second compiler/Projection registry or claim code/compile proof. Review only this source delta and save exact acceptance/gaps.

Choose the best authorized in-scope option when uncertain, record a C/Question and continue under the current Epic. You are not alone; preserve other edits and C447/C449 boundaries. Root saves completion from actual evidence only.

## Definition of Done

Save the bounded output, exact source revisions and truthful review/current frontier. This Task does not complete runtime gates or the Epic.

## Result

Independent repaired source review ACCEPT95% for D571@2 SHA-256 24dc030c0a95dc21c72a4b054c1eae088a004550bed0efd75265c2ad95fc753c and C454@2 a56191d3cbbbfe754db8e43f87def0cbcfc055d9c83bf1fd86815c941a26eb74. Existing in-memory compile_report/projection_bytes can predict complete output before D566; source-relative provenance is invariant under same-depth child hash substitution. Actual render equality, copy currentness and nested source preservation remain implementation gates. Source acceptance alone is not compiler or release proof.
