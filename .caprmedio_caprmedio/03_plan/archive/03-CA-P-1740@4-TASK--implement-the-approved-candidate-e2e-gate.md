# Summary

Implement the approved Candidate E2E gate

## Objective

Deliver the approved bounded host-side Candidate E2E implementation and complete Unit/E2E aggregation without relaxing the isolated Unit execution boundary.

## Details

The Operator approved three source-pinned host harnesses with promotion blocked until both phases pass. The required child sequence is P1741-P1749; execute independent ready ownership lanes in parallel. Fixed graph: compilation, Unit Gate, candidate image/canary, Candidate E2E, Full Gate aggregation, promotion. Actual full-suite and installation gates remain unfinished until real evidence. ETA is distributed into the bounded children below.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.

## Execution result

All required P1741-P1749 children and P1750-P1754 remainder children are Done with their scoped source/code proof saved. Independent bounded integration acceptance follows the cached actual-identity correction and provider 20/20 regression pass. Final accepted scoped evidence includes Full Gate 7/7, Unit/reference/phase 32/32, retained E2E 2/2, strict admission 14/14, Actions 27/27, checkpoint 8/8, Promotion 16/16, Image 53/53 and 13 fixture passes.

The follow-up D579 syntax correction preserves its version-4 claim/environment while renaming the conflicting TOML table; D572@9 rebinds only that changed source byte frontier. TOML parsing, strict admission 14/14 and the previously failing MCP discovery test 1/1 passed. The canonical sixteen-route loader is valid at manifest digest `b75653a790139ee0fb028e3c289e713a5b6b9e6f5367e8a52721e0258fb00e63`.

This closes the bounded implementation/aggregation composite, not actual full-suite Release acceptance. The real N+1 Run `release-first-cut-20261006-N1` is separately executing its required gates; no gate pass, promotion or deferred retirement is inferred here.
