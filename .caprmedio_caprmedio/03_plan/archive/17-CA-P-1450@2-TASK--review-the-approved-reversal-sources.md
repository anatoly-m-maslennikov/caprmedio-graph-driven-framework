# Summary

Review the approved reversal sources

## Objective

Complete one independent read-only source packet review in one assigned subagent, estimate <=15 minutes, inheriting CA-P-1117 v3's 90% threshold.

### Bound input and ownership

Independent review of the three newly authored Revert carriers O130/O131/O132 v1 and Done P1439. Reviewer must not be their author.

Own only this Plan. Fully read exact sources, inherited Goal/Principles, current permission/history/Run/Step authorities; compare requested approved reversal/currentness/no-op/history/reference/partial-failure/cancellation/journal guards against clauses. Return exact pass or typed findings to root. No source/code edits or runtime pass.

Read current Epic/source stage and this leaf. You are not alone: preserve peers' edits. Root owns typed Concerns, fixes and shared saves. No harvest/FPF/unrelated audit. Review actual clauses, not titles or metadata as proof.

### Output and verification

Save exact source revisions, bounded scenario verdicts, meaningful gaps/disposition and downstream readiness here. Reopen the saved Plan and confirm registered fields/headings/identity/whitespace. Record actual first/end clocks. Physically Done only for a complete review output; issues can remain explicitly gated but are not a clean source pass. No more than four changed Operations are reviewed in this leaf.

## Details

### Independent source review result

First actual clock2026-10-04 16:52:23UTC, unchanged. I did not author O130/O131/O132 or P1439. Fully read this leaf, all three exact v1 sources saved16:45:06UTC, physical Done P1439v1, current P1132v3, fresh Goal13/all14 Project Principles and the directly governing permission/history/Workflow/Step/Run/Journal authorities. Current P1117v3/P1119v3 qualified unchanged prior full reads;90% inherited. The reusable contribution has no caprmedio-specific path, implementation, CLI or vendor dependency, so CORE_META_MODEL is the correct current/target destination.

Definition validity is separate from executor availability, actual current permission, successful execution and confirmed Run evidence.

| Bound scenario / counterexample | Exact clauses and independent verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Approved exact reversal, versus old snapshot/prior-change permission or remembered approval | O131 Operation1 binds accepted effects, before/after evidence, exact ordered proposed effects/current authority, recorded Operator decision, safe recovery/cancellation boundary and capabilities. Missing or unsupported input blocks without mutation; O132 supplies every input from admitted request/recovery evidence. Pass; no inferred approval. |
| Concurrent target/reference change, revoked permission or changed definition | O131 Operation2/5 guard each current state and remaining-work compatibility; O130 Details and O132 bind exact definitions under R1525. No overwriting intervening work, substituting a Revision, or replaying completed/uncertain effects; an in-flight Action retains its admitted interruption policy under R1525. Pass. |
| History, identity, status and affected-reference preservation | O131 Operation3–4 apply current R1432/R1464/R1521 and O051/R807: fixed Summary, approved new-identity replacement when required, no ID reuse/Version regression/archive overwrite/active replacement-history relation or history deletion. Unsupported lifecycle/reference/dependent effects block. Pass. |
| Entire approved result already holds | O131 Operation2–4 and no_op row still require approval/currentness/history/references and durable Run evidence, with zero effects and no fictitious Artifact change; O130 maps no_op to completed_no_op. Pass; no-op is not an authorization shortcut. |
| All approved effects actually satisfied | O131 Operation4–5/reverted row requires ordered guarded effects and complete durable result/preservation evidence; O132 returns actual account unchanged; O130 maps reverted to completed. Pass; partial or unrecorded work is not completion. |
| Failure before/after effects or uncertain effect completion | O131 Operation4–5 preserves completed/failed/unattempted/uncertain effects and forbids blind replay; O130 preserves the account under its failed terminal. However O131 Outcomes lines42–43 have overlapping failed/partial_failure predicates for an uncertain first effect with zero confirmed effects. Finding F1; not a clean Action outcome-classification pass. |
| Admitted cancellation at safe boundary | O131 Operation1/4/canceled row preserve partial effects and unperformed remainder, not successful reversal; O130 routes canceled to canceled, with Abandoned event rather than a new Type. Pass. |
| Workflow start or Action start cannot be confirmed | O130 Details blocks Step dispatch; O131 Every Action Run blocks target effects, retaining known/pending evidence. No uninvoked Action Run is invented. Pass; pending/unpersisted records are not journaled Runs. |
| Terminal recording fails after actual effects | O130 Details/O131 recording_blocked row and Every Action Run retain actual execution outcome/effects and durable pending evidence. Identity/receipt reconciliation recovers recording without duplicate historical events or repeated effects; O132 preserves that handoff. Pass. |
| Standalone/nested/no-op/failed/canceled Runs | O131 Every Action Run requires distinct actual identity/definition/Actor/inputs/start/outcome/results/effects; real parent Workflow/Step lineage only when nested. O130/O132 retain Workflow/Step evidence, canonical Journal, admitted Event Types, append-only records, no secrets and derived secondary views. Pass; definitions/Tool delivery are not Run proof. |
| Graph/Step/Action separation and missing executor capability | O130 is one-node O132 terminal routing, with no next-Step/retry loop; O132 invokes one O131 Programmatic Action and owns all input/context bindings. O130's admission/completion/recording guards do not duplicate reversal mechanics. R1519 blocks unknown/unresolved execution rules; unavailable capability blocks admission rather than invalidating a declared definition or silently switching to Agentic execution. Pass. |

Independent verdict: the complete bounded review has one source finding, F1; the other scenarios pass. The explicit graph, complete Step bindings, actual clause boundaries and negative cases were assessed, not inferred from metadata or the author's receipt. No actual reversal, fixture, Run, Journal append, code or runtime test was executed. The provisional clean conclusion was corrected before saved-result verification/closure when the exact uncertain-first-effect counterexample exposed the overlap; no clean source pass or clock reset is claimed.

F1 is a narrow Problem in O131v1's Outcomes lines42–43. A first approved effect is attempted, its response fails, no effect is confirmed, and actual mutation remains uncertain. Both “fails before any approved effect is confirmed” and “effect completion is uncertain” hold; no explicit classifier precedence resolves failed versus partial_failure. The no-replay and retained-effect-account guards remain sound, and O130 maps both to failed, but a Programmatic implementation must not invent the missing outcome choice under R1519/E489. Reported directly to root for its typed Concern and a bounded correction/re-review: failed requires established zero applied/uncertain effects; any uncertain completion selects partial_failure even with zero confirmed effects, or an explicit equivalent unambiguous rule. No O130/O132 semantic change is needed for this finding. Root owns the actual disposition; affected O131/source-stage acceptance and dependent implementation remain gated.

This complete review output supplies root's Revert Changes source finding/disposition input, not clean triplet acceptance. The one saved-result conformance gate actually passed / exit0 at2026-10-04 17:02:42 UTC: four strict saved carriers, unchanged exact source bindings, registered sections/identity/whitespace/single EOF, O130→O132→O131 reference/type closure and complete scenario output with F1 explicitly gated. This is a review-result Carrier pass, not clean source acceptance or runtime proof. Only this Plan is edited; its Objective/Summary/Version1 and P1132/P1158/P1160 BLOCKS are retained. Physical completion edit2026-10-04 17:03:59 UTC is within15 minutes of the unchanged16:52:23UTC first clock. The review output is complete; the reported F1 remains root-owned for typed Problem disposition and separately bound correction/re-review. P1132's source/gap obligations and P1158/P1160 specification gates remain; affected code must not proceed from this review's Done status or bypass the unresolved source finding.

### Definition of Done

Truthful bounded independent result and exact evidence exist; any actual issue/remainder is reported to root for typed disposition before affected code proceeds. No unexecuted Runtime or journal coverage is claimed.
