# Summary

Review the Candidate E2E gate integration

## Objective

Independently accept the bounded E2E integration against current RMED and Release Operations.

## Details

Read-only source/code review and scoped tests of this slice, not the deferred final all-sixteen audit. Save source/mock evidence separately from actual complete suite and release gates, which remain P1717/P1721/P1739 obligations. ETA <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.

## Execution result

Independent read-only review of this bounded integration initially refused an undefined cached Action identity in `selected_native_providers.py`. The correction forwards the validated actual `action['run_id']` and adds a restored/cached canonical-receipt regression; provider 20/20 passed. The same independent reviewer revisited the saved patch and accepted the bounded P1747/P1748/P1749 surface with no remaining concrete blocker. Broad all-sixteen audit, actual full Docker suite, installation, promotion and deferred retirement remain separate unfinished gates.
