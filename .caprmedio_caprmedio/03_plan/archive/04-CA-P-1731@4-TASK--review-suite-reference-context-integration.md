# Summary

Review suite reference-context integration

## Objective

Independently review and verify the reference-context integration against its accepted sources.

## Details

Check the source/currentness boundary, no hidden input selection, before-and-after freshness, exact consumed references and truthful non-pass states. This is a Release prerequisite review, not the deferred final all-sixteen audit. Expected bounded effort <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The owned work is independently accepted and its real verification result is saved. Source or mock proof alone does not close the actual Release gate.

## Results

Independent helper safety, guard timing, retained image-reader and source-contract reviews accept the bounded implementation after repairs. The accepted composition includes all-root mutation coverage and actual pre-/post-call timing tests. Root passed 34 focused cases and the driver owner passed 12 golden cases; full Docker/Release execution remains gated separately.
