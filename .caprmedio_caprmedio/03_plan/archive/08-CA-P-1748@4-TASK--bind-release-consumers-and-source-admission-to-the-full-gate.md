# Summary

Bind Release consumers and source admission to the Full Gate

## Objective

Integrate candidate image, Release Actions, promotion and explicit source admission with the accepted two-phase gate.

## Details

Own bounded Release consumers/checkpoint adapters plus reviewed D572 source-frontier amendment and subsequent admission rebind only after prerequisite acceptance. Preserve N, pending Runs, current public manifest and rollback. No silent frontier widening or generic remote Docker interface. ETA <=15 minutes; split further if needed.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.

## Execution result

Scoped consumer and admission integration complete at `394c7916e`; cached actual-identity correction saved at `1606b342d`. Final terminal verification: Promotion 16/16, Image 53/53, Actions 27/27, checkpoint 8/8, provider 20/20, strict admission 14/14 and shared fixtures 13 scoped passes. D572@8 and the canonical sixteen-route manifest bind O164@5's twelve phases, 34 RMED pins and ten private carriers. Independent bounded review accepts the consumer linkage. No live install, promotion or image retirement is inferred.
