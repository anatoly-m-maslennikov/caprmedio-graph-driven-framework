# Summary

Prove HTTP sessions and security boundaries

## Objective

Prove HTTP sessions and security boundaries under the parent's exact source contract.

## Details

http_mcp_restore exclusively owns 204_MCP/tests/test_hot_reload_http.py and WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR/tests/test_mcp_http_runtime.py; bounded corrections touch only P1770-owned files.

Estimated execution slice <=15 minutes. Preserve other workers' changes. Root alone owns index, commits and actual shared runtime effects. Tests and disposable smoke evidence are not release promotion.

## Definition of Done

Real host SDK discovery/calls/reload/drain/cleanup and every-request auth/Host/Origin/health tests pass.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this exclusive bounded assignment as the minimal current parent repair. Preserve installed N and truthful observed effects.

## Recorded verification

e63cb5457; real host SDK protocol/security and slow-child cleanup tests passed. This is not a real Docker acceptance receipt.
