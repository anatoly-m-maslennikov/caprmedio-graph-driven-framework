# Summary

Verify sealed Release handoff boundaries

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, verify sealed Release handoff boundaries.

## Details

Own RELEASE_VERSION/tests/test_release_contract.py and new handoff-only fixtures/tests. Migrate the prototype corpus to accepted D566/D567/E572@2 with independent canonical checksum expectations, real temporary local source/config/selection snapshots, full Engine/Methodology/ca/image inputs and expected-versus-observed output separation. Prove forged caller mappings, stale pins, modes, paths and missing/full-copy/compiler evidence refuse. Coordinate API with P1656 owner. Existing development worker only; no actual image or full-release claim.

Read exact accepted sources and current files. You are not alone: preserve unrelated edits. Do not bypass C447/C449 or count a development worker as immutable-image/MCP/queue proof. Record actual saved output and remaining coverage.

## Definition of Done

The bounded assigned output, exact frontier and genuine focused evidence are saved. Source-only, mocked, partial or rejected work does not complete the composite, required runtime gates or Epic.

## Result

Saved the independent golden corpus: fourteen codec and thirteen handoff tests, with zero failures, errors or skips. Actual temporary files and independent checksum/tree oracles cover forged authority, stale inputs, modes, unsafe paths, incomplete source copy and failed compiler evidence. test_release_contract.py SHA-256 edc319999c1cfffeba862d46c7d5219e47536124b7b2fd3e5822ad5801326db1; test_release_handoff.py 557f53ea6fcfaa3be950972ffe39deefd0ef0e4e43ce8fd605ad809c268084ea; release_handoff_fixture.py ebd8ba78bd96334a57b23a5be795d1d11a5f0bcc494f2aaa614526e628106d42. Root reran all twenty-seven tests against the current production hashes in CA-P-1656. Mocked compiler evidence proves only the contract, not compilation, staging, installation, image or release completion.
