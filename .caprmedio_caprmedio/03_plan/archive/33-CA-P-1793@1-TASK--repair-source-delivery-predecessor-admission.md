# Summary

Repair source delivery predecessor admission

## Objective

restore safe source-delivery admission for a fresh Release using exact independently accepted predecessor ownership evidence, without weakening unknown-file, currentness or recording guards.

## Details

- N11 is terminally interrupted before delivery with release-copy-predecessor-mismatch. retain its 14 Journal rows and do not replay it.
- code diagnosis, actual-tree comparison, source-authority review and test-first fixture work are separate bounded lanes. root owns source pins, integration, Git and fresh MCP dispatch.
- the finite Unit budget repair is independently accepted: 147 focused tests passed; guarded binding revision 6 is recorded. no complete fresh Unit gate has yet used that budget.
- choose the smallest safe correction and preserve any actual predecessor tree. arbitrary or unproven files remain protected; installed N and historical records remain unchanged.
- use a fresh source-bound N12 only after source/code/evidence acceptance. all Unit, image/canary, Candidate E2E, Full Gate and promotion criteria remain required.

## Definition of Done

the exact mismatch is explained; source and any code correction are independently accepted; ownership, tamper and no-effect regressions pass; a fresh Release completes source delivery with actual recorded evidence.

## Result

the registered predecessor reader and source contract are independently accepted. 103 distinct focused tests pass, including exact ownership, tamper and no-effect refusals. actual N12 Step 3 completed source delivery; the new delivered tree is `504136b891165dcaef4dbc393e2c3af596e1fab6ea4d35b02584aedab4f0ed3c`. its retained predecessor at `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/.release-sources-prior-w0rqbxah` matches the N10 tree `7ff204b0618234550599ce41b617a03d9c6b785469e122fb5746adf948a8a605`.

the independent actual-tree review confirms the old N10 Action/checkpoint hashes, historical Journal prefix and installed N remain unchanged. this completes source-delivery admission only; current Unit and every later Release gate remain unfinished.
