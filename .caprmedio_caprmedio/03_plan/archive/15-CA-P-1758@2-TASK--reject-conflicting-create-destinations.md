# Summary

Reject conflicting Create destinations

## Objective

Reject occupied Create destinations instead of reporting a pathname-only duplicate as a successful no-op.

## Details

lifecycle_intents.py and focused lifecycle tests; audit_lifecycle_structural. Current O128 and identity/status contracts govern. Preserve existing carrier bytes.

Estimated bounded slice: <=15 minutes. Workers share the checkout, preserve other edits and do not stage or commit. Root owns integration and Git. Preparation does not prove runtime execution.

## Definition of Done

Conflicting occupied path fails before effects; neighboring lifecycle/status tests pass without weakening current authority.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded repair/restoration against Operator authority, DRY, preservation of valuable information and the latest continuation. Keep installed N intact and distinguish local tests from required actual runtime gates.

## Recorded verification

8dd986d0a retains the occupied-Create fix and current status fixtures. Forty-one focused lifecycle/status tests passed. No shared Project mutation or live Docker proof is claimed.
