# Summary

Correct current Epic archive Status carriers

## Objective

Repair only six newly authored whole prior snapshots of O010@7/@8, O011@10/@11 and O015@6/@7 in Core/09_operations/archive. They still carry explicit Active. Preserve Version/identity/meaning/body/all other metadata; change only Status to Archived and actual Updated At under current lifecycle rules. Do not touch older pre-Epic history or current Workflow/Step files. Own exact six archives, this Plan and narrow C427. One saved full comparison must prove only those two metadata changes. No runtime/source-generation claim. Estimate <=8 minutes.

Use current relevant authority; you are not alone, preserve others' edits. Root owns source-stage acceptance and dependent gating. Record actual clock and one proportionate saved result check.

## Details

### Bound execution and result

First recorded actual clock: 2026-10-04 17:54:05 UTC. Read bound P1478v1, current P1117v3, current native R1788v1/R1432v9/D289v12, and supporting D270v13/R1521v4/O067v6/R1419v9 at their actual authoritative Core source paths. R1419 admits Archived for these prior Revisions. The correction is classified carrier_only: it makes the six archive Status carriers agree with their prior-Revision placement without altering their Summary, definition, identity or Version. Actual archive edit instant: 2026-10-04 17:55:44 +0000. Each full file was read before and after the patch; the permitted lossless comparison below passed 2026-10-04 17:56:29 UTC.

### Saved complete before/after comparison

The exact root for every basename below is `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/archive/`. The check compared the complete UTF-8 file bytes, not an extracted body or selected YAML properties. For each of all six files, the saved post-edit string equaled the captured pre-edit string after exactly two replacements: the unique frontmatter `status: "Active"` became `status: "Archived"`; the unique frontmatter `updated_at` became `updated_at: "2026-10-04 17:55:44 +0000"`. Equality passed with no other byte difference; each file grew by exactly two bytes from Active to Archived. Existing EOF, body, Summary, Atom ID, Version, Subjects, Relations, ownership, tiers and every other metadata value remained exact. Version equals the unchanged @version basename in every case.

Full SHA-256 proof for all six files follows. The masked hash is identical before and after when only the two permitted frontmatter lines are replaced by fixed markers; the complete-file equality above establishes that every remaining byte is preserved. It is not a source-generation or runtime result.

### Terminal disposition

C427 records and resolves only this six-carrier defect. The saved-carrier check found one extra EOF blank line in the new Concern; it was removed and that Concern's actual Updated At refreshed. Its content and disposition were unchanged. Completed this bounded correction, with this Plan physically in local done, at 2026-10-04 17:58:53 +0000; the first recorded clock remains unchanged and the <=8-minute estimate was respected. Root owns source-stage acceptance and dependent gates. Current Workflow/Step sources, older pre-Epic snapshots, code, sessions, FPF, Git and Journal were outside the patch. There is no runtime, whole-source acceptance, source-generation, Tool save receipt or Journal provenance claim.


### Definition of Done

The exact bounded deliverable is saved and limitations remain explicit. Physical done/ denotes this work's completion only; no broader source/runtime delivery is inferred.
