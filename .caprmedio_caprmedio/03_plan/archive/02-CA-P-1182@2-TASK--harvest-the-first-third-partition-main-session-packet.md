# Summary

Harvest the first third-partition main-session packet

## Objective

One assigned AI Agent must substantively harvest exactly the 12 complete primary visible human/assistant message records bound below into durable CA-A-908, record traceable workflows/processes, Steps, Actions, user-facing prompts and main-session handoffs with decision/supersession dispositions, and bind the actual next remainder within <=15 minutes. This is the actual content harvest leaf, not another metadata or generic packet preflight. It inherits CA-P-1117's permissions and 90% safe-choice policy through CA-P-1128.

### Exact inputs and live governing revisions

- Incoming preparation: CA-P-1153 v3, Done, `done/01-CA-P-1153-TASK--bind-the-next-executable-work-packet.md` in this bundle. It explicitly BLOCKS this leaf. Incoming metadata CA-P-1125 v4 and CA-P-1176 v2 are Done; CA-A-905 v1 carries all 1659 rows /1657 IDs and the source frontiers. Supplemental manifests are not the sole source authority.
- Parent CA-P-1128 v3 declares the exact partition [2026-09-20 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-09-28 05:54:15 +0400), equivalent to [2026-09-20T01:54:15Z, 2026-09-28T01:54:15Z). The Epic CA-P-1117 v1 keeps the overall thirty-day cutoff unchanged. Later Operator amendments remain separate from historical evidence.
- Source: primary VS Code main session `01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6`, exact current Project cwd and repository URL corroborated in CA-A-905. Read-only path `/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl`. Source append activity after the frozen cutoff does not shift the packet or grant extra inputs.
- Live external Goal v13 at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/ANATOLY-MASLENNIKOV-DEFINES_GOAL_FOR-caprmedio--create-and-evolve-a-working-caprmedio-framework.md`; active Project Principles CA-R-819 v13, R-1490 v1, R-1407 v5, R-1420 v5, R-1421 v4, R-1423 v4, M-001 v10, M-002 v15, M-005 v8, M-006 v8, M-261 v5, E-001 v12; legacy Actor Principles CA-P-032 v5 and CA-P-033 v9 and permission Core CA-P-034 v6. Re-read the live carriers before autonomous decisions and check for revision drift.
- Authoritative Plan source revisions beneath `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL`: CA-R-1589 v4, CA-R-1580 v4, CA-D-460 v6, CA-D-470 v7, CA-D-481 v4. Read sources, not the derived projection. Existing CA-C-293 records the local full-parser limitation; use system Python standard-library verification and do not repair the environment. Existing CA-C-294's candidate identity check remains a separate unprocessed corpus frontier.

### Canonical complete-message packet

Admit only `response_item` payloads with `type: message`, `role: user|assistant`, and a visible channel (`null`, `commentary` or `final`), preserving the actual channel. Exclude internal `analysis`, tool/function records/results, developer/system messages, environment-context carrier records and `event_msg` mirrors. The source's packet records all carry channel null. Record counts mean source message records, not independently deduplicated Operator decisions. Harvest must detect copied/quoted context and preserve its provenance/supersession rather than silently promoting it.

The packet has exactly 12 complete records and 4419 text characters. Byte ranges are zero-based and end-exclusive; line numbers are one-based. `record_sha256` hashes the entire raw UTF-8 JSONL line including its newline. Keep each message complete; if a runtime/context bound prevents reading a complete message, postpone or decompose explicitly and retain the exact unconsumed boundary. Never silently truncate an oversized message.

### Owned target and required result

Own only this leaf's result/Done placement; durable `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-908-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-first-third-partition-main-session-packet.md` (reserved unique ID, unauthored at binding); CA-P-1128's immediate bundle/roll-up; exact required remainder Plans/readiness edges and narrowly owned typed Concerns. Do not author Operations/RMED, implement code, modify Docker/environment, repair source authority, commit, or harvest any additional source body in this leaf.

CA-A-908 must retain the packet identity and complete hash/line/byte/timestamp boundaries, actual processed message count, traceable candidate/decision records, explicit Operator corrections and assistant-proposal acceptance/supersession disposition, reusable workflow/Step/Action/prompt/handoff candidates, and exact unprocessed frontiers. A statement about updating Atoms or tool execution is a historical statement, not current proof that repository authority or implementation changed. Record no-candidate messages explicitly so processed coverage is checkable.

Before closing, create the actual next <=15-minute harvest child for the same source starting at line 24053, bytes [512649985,512650652), timestamp 2026-09-20T15:47:21.583Z, assistant/channel null, raw-record SHA-256 `9b53c9e500e88051d71310a5be19530c155e477f8b68cec052f43f80f1067f3f`. Bind its complete-message packet without silently truncating and carry all remaining 1163 visible records through line 59916, 2026-09-28T01:50:11.416Z, beneath the unchanged exclusive partition cutoff. The remaining non-message record interval, nine excluded environment carriers and non-primary evidence keep their exact source/frontier dispositions; exclusion from visible-message counts is not deletion of source evidence.

Retain both main-session continuation paths and the limited 12-content-signature overlap observation from CA-P-1153/CA-P-1128. The original file has zero third-partition event records by parsed timestamps; it is not discarded from the corpus or other partition work. Preserve CA-A-905's 1657 other retained rows and their full availability/body-window frontiers, including other primary files, the structure continuation pair, verified metadata parent/repository sources, all 1642 worker files and CA-C-294's candidate identity check. New concrete remainder/repair/re-review leaves must BLOCK CA-P-1119, CA-P-1130 and CA-P-1155; CA-P-1128 stays Active while any partition work remains. Do not create another generic metadata preflight.

### Functional verification and decision disposition

Run the following standard-library check from the Project root before content reading; it verifies exact complete input records without exposing intervening tool/internal payloads:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
import hashlib,json,pathlib,re
plan=pathlib.Path('.caprmedio_caprmedio/03_plan/15-CA-P-1117-EPIC--harvest-and-implement-session-derived-operations/01-CA-P-1118-TASK--harvest-the-thirty-day-session-evidence/04-CA-P-1128-TASK--harvest-the-third-session-evidence-partition/done/02-CA-P-1182@2-TASK--harvest-the-first-third-partition-main-session-packet.md')
rows=json.loads(re.search(r'```json\n(.*?)\n```',plan.read_text(),re.S).group(1))
source=pathlib.Path('/Users/am/.codex/sessions/2026/09/15/rollout-2026-09-15T19-25-02-01a02650-eff7-7453-8c37-0699b36773c6_01a0a5ab-e9a3-79e0-a7d3-110195054118.jsonl')
assert len(rows)==12 and sum(r['text_characters'] for r in rows)==4419
with source.open('rb') as f:
    for r in rows:
        f.seek(r['byte_start']); raw=f.read(r['byte_end_exclusive']-r['byte_start'])
        assert raw.endswith(b'\n') and hashlib.sha256(raw).hexdigest()==r['record_sha256']
        d=json.loads(raw); p=d['payload']
        assert d['type']=='response_item' and p['type']=='message'
        assert d['timestamp']==r['timestamp'] and p['role']==r['role'] and p.get('channel')==r['channel']
        text='\n'.join(c.get('text','') for c in p.get('content',[]) if c.get('type') in ('input_text','output_text','text'))
        assert len(text)==r['text_characters'] and not text.lstrip().startswith('<environment_context>')
print('PASS: 12 complete canonical visible message records; 4419 text characters')
PY
```

After harvest, functionally reconcile CA-A-908's processed-record keys against all 12 declared line/hash pairs: every included message must have a candidate/decision or justified no-candidate disposition, all sources/revisions and supersession references must resolve, and the next remainder's first raw record must match the bound next-line hash. Check mandatory Plan/Analysis sections and properties, unique IDs, immediate decomposition and Done placement, and the acyclic explicit BLOCKS/decomposition completion graph. Retain the actual verification outcome; do not claim unavailable full YAML parsing ran.

Packet selection itself is >=90% confidence and presents no unresolved Operator decision. If harvest reveals uncertainty below 90%, check the live Goal/Principles, record the best safe authorized choice in C/Question and proceed only within the Epic's policy. Permission/runtime/evidence/authority blockers require C/Problem or C/Conflict, truthful postponement and exact remaining frontier. Request an unused Concern ID from the root when needed. Preparation/hash indexing is not substantive coverage and cannot be counted as this leaf's completion.

### Substantive harvest result and dependent review

Completed the bound 12 full messages /4419 text characters into `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-908-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-first-third-partition-main-session-packet.md` v1. D01–D12 retain every exact source-event/hash and evidence/disposition. Five candidate groups cover Step invocation kinds/modes, integrated continuation prompt/MCP handoff, isolated invocation, nested Tool-call trace and contextual Change Status/relation-repair handoff. Operator line23977 corrects earlier Workflow-wide mode placement to Step invocation; line24001 accepts the corrected discussion including Tool calls as trace records rather than automatic sub-steps. Change Status's earlier agreement remains unconsumed contextual provenance. Assistant promise/report lines24004/24030 are not current authority or implementation verification; the historical active-target issue is retained for CA-P-1130's later source check, not invented as a current Conflict.

Created the actual next sibling CA-P-1192 at `03-CA-P-1192-TASK--harvest-the-second-third-partition-main-session-packet.md`, one AI Agent and <=15 minutes, with 12 complete messages /4613 text characters, sparse lines24053–24151 and byte envelope [512649985,513524656). First hash exactly matches the required `9b53c9e500e88051d71310a5be19530c155e477f8b68cec052f43f80f1067f3f`. Unique CA-A-913 is reserved for its durable result; its saved Plan contains all complete-message boundaries, live authority, ownership, output and executable exact-byte verification. All1163 remaining continuation messages remain substantively unprocessed; after the new bound packet, 1151 begin at line24154 with exact boundaries/hash in CA-P-1192/CA-A-908. Every other CA-A-905 source/frontier, both main files, limited continuation overlap, excluded environment/non-message evidence and candidate identity check remain retained.

Reviewed CA-P-1119, CA-P-1130 and CA-P-1155's current objectives and readiness: their substantive harvest/current-source requirements remain unmet. Added CA-P-1182@2 BLOCKS CA-P-1192 and CA-P-1192 BLOCKS all three gates; CA-P-1128 remains Active with its existing direct gates. The downstream reconciliation owner receives CA-A-908 candidate/provisional/historical dispositions, not assumed adopted Operations. Live Goal/Principles and authoritative Plan revisions matched the binding; no below-threshold decision or current blocker was encountered, so no new Concern is needed. No Git, O/RMED, engine, Docker, environment or source authority changed.

Functional checks passed: exact bytes/raw SHA-256, canonical type/role/channel/timestamp and full text counts for both 12-message packets; saved CA-A-908 has all 12 unique line/hash keys, D01–D12 and valid candidate references; required Analysis/Plan sections/properties, unique live IDs, immediate parent/Done placement, retained gates, final-newline format and acyclic explicit completion graph. Standard-library checks were used; unavailable full YAML parsing was not claimed. The complete bounded leaf finished within <=15 minutes; no save receipt or Journal provenance was invented.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This leaf is not Done if any of its 12 complete messages lacks a traceable processed disposition in durable CA-A-908; input hashes or live governing authority fail verification; source identity, corrections, proposal adoption or supersession are misstated; any substantive content was silently truncated; any new issue lacks its typed Concern/disposition; the exact next remainder and all other corpus/body frontiers or downstream readiness edges disappear; the parent is incorrectly marked Done; verification evidence is absent; affected dependents were not reviewed/updated; or work exceeds <=15 minutes without explicit narrower unfinished Plans. It has one assigned AI Agent, no direct decomposition at admission, and an estimate of <=15 minutes.
