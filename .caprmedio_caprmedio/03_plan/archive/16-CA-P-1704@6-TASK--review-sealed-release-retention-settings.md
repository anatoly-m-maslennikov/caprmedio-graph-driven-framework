# Summary

Review sealed Release retention settings

## Objective

Within <=5 minutes, independently accept or reject the exact D573 settings contract against the existing Release safety authority.

## Details

Read-only review of D573 SHA08baf33ec1200468c132237561bd92cf6a9a5322aa76636cca87261fe2c27bcd, R1879/R1880/M333/O169, existing D566 settings digest and C466. Verify one Carrier Claim, self-sufficiency, explicit setting approval rather than caller flags, unknown/retain/conditional retention semantics, immutable exact identity, no force/prune, and no automatic Action or deletion. Confirm the new frontier pin can be added to D572 only after current acceptance. No source/code/settings/Plan/Git changes or image/runtime work; no broad audit.

## Definition of Done

Save exact accepted/rejected hashes, confidence and specific blocking findings. D572 admission update, conditional removal implementation and actual image proof remain separate.

### Current bounded completion

Initial exact D573@1 review REJECT94% found completed verification could be failed and lacked explicit same-candidate successful terminal evidence. P1705 repaired only that predicate. Current D573@2 SHA5db7045ec34fbd9aea129d63262f6fce1ac5a6bff2b147af90a9fad6e560adad is independently ACCEPTED99%; the exact v1 archive remains08baf33ec1200468c132237561bd92cf6a9a5322aa76636cca87261fe2c27bcd. Settings authority/unknown-to-retain/no caller flags/required-reference retention/no force remain unchanged. This is source-only acceptance; no values, admission, code or image effect is proved.
