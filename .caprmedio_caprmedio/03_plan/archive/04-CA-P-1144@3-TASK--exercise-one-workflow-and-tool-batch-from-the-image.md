# Summary

Exercise one workflow and tool batch from the image

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for exercise one workflow and tool batch from the image, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Select at most one implemented workflow and three tools from the frozen complete-runtime matrix. Run their public entrypoints inside the built image against isolated fixture project inputs. Cover observable results, authorized mutations and Journal/Git handling where applicable, and safe recovery; no undeclared host implementation mounts.

### Required output

Image-bound functional/E2E results linked to exact image and capability IDs. Every failure/unavailable runtime becomes a C/Problem; remaining workflows/tools get new leaf files. Parent completion requires every implemented workflow and other tool to have passing image-based execution evidence.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
