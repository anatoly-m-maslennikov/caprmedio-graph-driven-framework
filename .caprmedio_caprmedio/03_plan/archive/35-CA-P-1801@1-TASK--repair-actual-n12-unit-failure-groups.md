# Summary

Repair actual N12 Unit failure groups

## Objective

repair the five independently owned groups of actual N12 Unit failures before freezing another release candidate.

## Details

- N12 ran 1,987 cases in 2,909.715539457997 seconds: 26 failures, 23 errors, zero skipped. the sealed report and receipt remain at `.caprmedio_runtime/release_suite/72616b32ea0d9349ee82c407e9600f9bf0726ef17b38db47edbed8bca2f1fdc4/attempt-enndonce/`.
- five independent lanes own distinct files. resolve confirmed defects from their exact report and current authority; fixture failure is not permission to weaken production gates.
- N12 ended with post-suite source-currentness stale and three durably recorded interruptions. retain its 22 actual Events and do not replay or rebind it.
- root owns source pins, integration, actual publication, Git and a fresh N13. installed N remains the rollback runtime.

## Definition of Done

all five groups have confirmed root causes, bounded independently accepted repairs and passing focused tests; a fresh source-bound candidate passes the complete Unit and later mandatory release gates.
