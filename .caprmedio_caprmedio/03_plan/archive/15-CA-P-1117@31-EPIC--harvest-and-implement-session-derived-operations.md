# Summary

Harvest and implement session-derived operations

## Objective

Deliver the first usable CAPRMEDIO cut selected by the Operator on 2026-10-08: the six retained Workflows below, with working stdio MCP, orchestration, shared Run journaling and HTTP MCP served from a Docker container. Reuse existing Actions, Tools, prompts, runtime infrastructure and reviewed RMED/O; finish only the implementation and acceptance needed for that cut.

### First-cut scope — current authority

The Operator's 2026-10-08 amendment supersedes earlier all-sixteen delivery, restored-optional-work and comprehensive release/audit obligations in this Epic. Older progress paragraphs below are retained evidence, not the current queue.

Required Workflows:

1. Create Atom.
2. Update Atom.
3. Replace Atom.
4. Change Atom Status, including Archive through the same generic status capability.
5. Implementation Workflow.
6. Build Applicable Methodology.

Required supporting capabilities:

- existing stdio MCP and the orchestrator;
- truthful shared Workflow/Action Run journaling; and
- HTTP MCP served from a Docker container, bound to localhost, with current authenticated initialize/list/call, health and lifecycle checks, invalid credentials/Host/Origin refusal and continued stdio compatibility.

Deferred delivery and extra acceptance: all Scope Unit mutation Workflows, Revert Changes automation, Entities/Terms Graph builders, standalone advanced Artifact/Journal query delivery, automated Release Version/upgrades, conditional prior-image retirement, extra recovery hardening and comprehensive sixteen-Workflow auditing. Preserve their existing sources, implementations, tests, task states and historical evidence. They remain later-milestone work; do not delete them, report them Done or use their unfinished delivery/audit tasks as first-cut blockers.

Only necessary supporting code is included even if reused from a deferred branch. Its correctness, permission, secret, identity, currentness, preservation and Journal boundaries remain required. Do not hide a defect in a retained execution path by calling its owning tool optional.

This first cut is not a claim of a complete automated N-to-N+1 release or promotion. Preserve installed N and its rollback proof. Existing normative Unit/E2E/Full Gate/promotion requirements still govern any actual formal Release or selected-runtime replacement; this scope amendment neither dispatches that deferred Workflow nor edits or bypasses its RMED. Required first-cut functional/container/HTTP acceptance remains real and source-bound.

### Retained working-runtime and release history

Canonical methodology Workflow `release-methodology-first-cut-20261006-01` actually compiled 1,035 selected source Atoms with no source conflicts, completed its canonical Journal receipts, and passed currentness verification. The verified gate integration and derived output are saved at `394c7916e`; later bounded startup/cached-result corrections are saved separately.

The actual initial runtime N is installed and independently accepted: package/selector SHA `6f2e3a615a4f4d6da0f16831800f9e4b7ff84f89b89faeefc359f51711d28c57`, immutable image `sha256:79899cfe59fb36c8da5ce1c12ea52c529a61738e51100b3d3e8488c52496d54e`, all 15,135 packaged files with exact bytes/modes/pathset, and the two-file hook-free project-local `ca` Skill. Actual build/inspect/canary all exited 0; the canary verified 28 MCP Tools. O180 Run `first-framework-runtime-20261006-03` has canonical started/completed facts and verified receipts. P1739 and its first-install composite P1714 are Done; C449 is resolved.

P1747-P1749's bounded code integration is independently accepted and Done. Its source/mock test passes remain distinct from real Release acceptance. Complete N-to-N+1 Unit, image/canary, three-harness Candidate E2E, Full Gate and recorded promotion remain the next required vertical cut. Keep installed N immutable as the working baseline and rollback point; no N+1 dispatch, promotion or old-image removal is claimed here.

The Operator now restores all previously postponed required work: the all-sixteen final code/coverage audit, localhost HTTP MCP alongside stdio, expanded restart/recovery cases, and conditional exact prior-image retirement. Canceled harvesting and explicitly excluded legacy administration remain excluded. Every executed Workflow/Action still requires actual Journal evidence. Installed N remains the working baseline until a candidate passes all required gates.

Release Run `release-first-cut-20261006-N5` stopped at the closed Unit gate: 1,636 testcase outcomes, 874 passing, 701 errors and 61 failures. The dominant failure was fixture scratch inside a read-only candidate workspace. Its interruption is already recorded and its checkpoint has no pending events; do not replay it or use recording recovery to imply release success. After the bounded harness and confirmed product repairs, admit a fresh Run with fresh sources. No N+1 package, image, promotion or retirement resulted from N5.

P1755-P1764 bind the current bounded repairs and restored HTTP/restart proof. P1765-P1772 carry the independently bounded suite/HTTP assignments. Their local acceptance does not substitute for the existing release, status, query and final-audit execution gates. The final review identified occupied Create conflicts, incomplete structural-change coverage, graph secret/recording boundaries, compiler publication freshness and workspace ancestor aliases as defects to repair before closure.

Fresh Run `release-epic-resume-20261006-N6` stopped before the test gate with `release-copy-ownership-unproven`. Its interruption is recorded and no pending events remain. P1774/C491 own diagnosis and bounded repair; no delivery, image or promotion is claimed. P1773 owns exact admitted Harness pin maintenance. After accepted repairs, use another fresh source-bound Run; retain N6 as evidence without replay.

P1775-P1778's lifecycle, structural and Implementation packet source repairs are independently accepted and locally Done. Real disposable Release-host/MCP recovery retained one actual delivery terminal after a writer fault, rejected stale source/tampered binding recovery, and recorded the original event once without replay. These local proofs do not establish full Docker release acceptance.

Fresh N7 completed delivery and compilation, then stopped before Unit execution because Finder metadata changed the raw retained bootstrap proof-context digest. P1779/C495 repair this reader mismatch without changing N or proof bytes; thirteen focused tests and actual retained-N reopening pass. N7's interruption is recorded with no pending events. Retain N5/N6/N7 and use a fresh source-bound candidate for remaining gates; no promotion or retirement is claimed.

Fresh N8 completed delivery and compilation and actually ran the sealed Unit container. Its gate failed after 548.054 seconds: JUnit reports 554 observed testcases, 14 failures and 206 errors, including module-discovery/reporting errors after the one-GiB temporary filesystem filled. Its failed evidence remains at `.caprmedio_runtime/release_suite/f735f40bdc34d8f01404c9621a6bebfed890d492324117bebb5a7faf3a2206e1/attempt-4_7b454u/`. The Workflow stopped at the Unit gate, interruption is recorded, and no pending recordings remain. Scheduler success is not release success. Independent fixture repairs, gitless Project boundaries and module-scoped executable scratch are under verification for a fresh N9; no image construction, promotion or retirement resulted from N8. Preserve N8 without replay and installed N unchanged.

The bounded N8 source repairs are saved: module-owned executable scratch, gitless Project-root recognition, current graph-settings lookup, exact Tool private-reader dependencies, and settings-bound Project Structure in the sealed reference context. Independent review accepts the closure repairs; thirteen reference-context cases, forty-six related release cases, fourteen source-admission cases, seventeen promotion cases and fifty-three image cases pass locally. The promotion/image Unit fixtures retain real byte/mode currentness checks and mock command execution only. These checks are not a new complete release gate. Fresh dispatch is blocked by CA-C-496: the canonical sixteen-route binding retains predecessor source pins, while the private publisher only admits initial fifteen-to-sixteen publication. Do not reset the binding or hand-edit it to bypass admission. A guarded, source-first refresh capability and its authorization must be settled before a fresh Release preview. Installed N's selector and image are reopened unchanged; N9 has not been dispatched.

the N11 predecessor mismatch has an accepted source-first repair. R1878/M332/E574 establish predecessor-only source-copy evidence; D567 prospectively binds the exact currently verified historical Action/checkpoint, same-N lineage and complete mode-aware inventory. this is current evidence admission, not historical sealing, old authorization reuse or replay. the original N10 admission is retained in D567@3; current D567 v4 binds N12. P1793 is Done and C500 resolved after N12 actually delivered and compiled its sources. installed N and historical Events remain unchanged.

fresh N12 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N12` completed delivery and compilation and ran the complete closed Unit suite: 1,987 testcase outcomes, 26 failures, 23 errors and zero skipped in 2909.715539457997 seconds. the later currentness guard correctly interrupted the Run after final-review source changes. all 22 actual Run Events are retained (11 starts, 8 completions, 3 interruptions), with no pending recording or implied later gate. no package/image/canary/E2E/Full Gate/promotion/retirement followed. P1801 decomposes the 49 observed fixture failures into five bounded lanes; their focused acceptance does not replace a fresh integration gate.

the prepared-new replacement source contract is accepted as R1041 v8 and O128 v4. its exact registered eight-occurrence lifecycle pin refresh was actually published as binding revision 8; the subsequent normal Release-admission refresh publishes revision 9, canonical digest `e26598708056b90f9bea85148a02b98bab51a74d66b987f1232ad1cb18eb77aa`, with all sixteen route identities/topology unchanged and exact Journal receipts. D572 v14 binds D567 v4 and D580 v5. strict source loading accepts the current projection. all sixteen exact route contexts are now live, complete and current. shared Action context exposes its admitted routes without choosing one implicitly. historical N12 observation returns its actual interruption and all 22 receipts without re-admitting effects. all five N12 fixture lanes have accepted bounded repairs; the final two image-policy regressions pass (2 tests, 77.339 seconds, exit 0). focused acceptance is not a complete Release gate. prepare a fresh N13 from these committed sources; do not replay N12 or change installed N before all mandatory gates pass.

fresh N13 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N13` completed source delivery and compilation, then stopped at its complete Unit gate: 2,009 testcase outcomes, 22 failures, 12 errors and zero skipped in 2441.773051917 seconds. its retained snapshot is `1945f7bf7b02b8550c04a39b57d6e39ead4a4ea3a45b317f4580a7d0bf3713f3`; all 22 actual Run Events are recorded, with no pending recording. scheduler success is not Release success. no package, image, canary, Candidate E2E, Full Gate, promotion or retirement followed. preserve N13 without replay and installed N unchanged.

CA-P-1809 owns six bounded N13 failure groups. the graph, historical-status, pending-recording, image-helper and sealed MCP fixture repairs have independent focused acceptance; sealed reference-context integration remains in progress. the exact-image image-fixture chain passed ten cases, but its causal contribution to N13's full-module failures remains unproven until the next full gate. D567 v5 prospectively authenticates the occupied N13 source copy without reusing its authorization. D580 v7 admits the five exact selected-refresh authority/dependency sources, including R1041, in the sealed Unit reference closure; D572 v16 pins the repaired reader. the actual guarded binding refresh was recorded with canonical digest `202e94a68aebcab765be6508e3ef00d38426e2164282bc7eef754c4ca5e34386`, preserving all sixteen routes. CA-P-1816 retains per-route actual Candidate E2E evidence before disposable fixture cleanup; no real captures yet exist. admit a fresh N14 only after accepted repairs, fresh source/currentness checks and Worker reload.

all six CA-P-1809 repair children now have bounded independent acceptance and are Done. the full reference-context module passed 18 tests; actual sealed/gitless selected-refresh reconstruction passed six cases; final D572 source admission passed fourteen cases. the historical refresh fixture preserves the exact retained D572@13 reader bytes rather than rewriting its controls. the reloaded Release host is ready at PID 54871, with no pending or queued historical Run to recover. installed N remains unchanged. fresh N14 still must independently pass the complete Unit gate and every later mandatory Release gate before the parent repairs or Epic can close.

fresh N14 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N14` delivered sources and compiled, then its disposable Unit container was deliberately stopped after parallel final review proved a shared retained-fixture setup gap. the exact source-bound container was inspected before stop; no other container was targeted. its actual receipt records exit 137 after 104.1833622080012 seconds, no JUnit report and zero validated-report tests: incomplete, not a pass or proof that no tests ran. all 22 actual Run Events are recorded with no pending recording. installed N is unchanged; no package/image/E2E/promotion/retirement followed. preserve N14 without replay. CA-P-1815 is reopened for the shared five-source fixture closure; CA-C-516 records the bounded early-stop choice under this Epic's autonomy. fresh N15 requires accepted shared-fixture regressions and independently current source sealing before every unchanged mandatory gate.

the shared five-source fixture repair is independently accepted and committed at dfc76e4f0. CA-P-1815 is Done again: reference-context 19/19, selected-refresh 6/6, retained E2E fixtures 2/2, E2E context 13/13, full-gate fixtures 7/7 and complete E2E-gate fixtures 11/11 pass with actual terminal results. installed N and the current sixteen-route source binding remain unchanged; the occupied methodology copy still passes current D567 predecessor verification and the Release host has no pending or queued Run. prepare and admit fresh N15 through the exact MCP preview/seal; focused fixture acceptance does not waive any Unit, package, image, canary, Candidate E2E, aggregate, promotion or conditional prior-image disposition gate.

fresh N15 was actually admitted through MCP after independent exact-seal review, with 25 requested Runs and snapshot `3bfdd04e1b9901c97a6af49c59e01731c456ea5313816db657457e94bd35a9f7`. source delivery and compilation completed. the host then disappeared while the Unit effect was in progress. its container later exited and retained a child JUnit report: 2,011 cases, 1,986 successes, 24 failures, one error and no skipped cases. no terminal Unit receipt or captured exit code exists; DBOS remains PENDING, the checkpoint retains in_progress, and there is no pending recording to retry. this is unresolved execution evidence, not a Release pass or a complete terminal Unit outcome. preserve N15 without replay and installed N unchanged.

CA-C-517 records the Operator's explicit approval to implement a guarded interrupted/unknown disposition for N15, preserving history and all no-replay/pass gates. independent lanes prepared the exact memory-boundary and host-independent deadline repairs, identified three MCP failures as thread-creation failures before their assertions, and captured the full child report with hashes. CA-P-1810 is reopened for the residual image-fixture resource boundary. current source-first packets are M343@5/D579@7/E586@4 and new R1895/M351/E594/D589 for the guarded resolver; authoring is not independent acceptance or implementation. root retains canonical integration, Git, binding publication and actual MCP effects. no restart, unknown terminal fact, promotion or retirement is claimed by these prepared packets.

### Retained earlier scope and release history

CA-P-1780 and CA-P-1781 are Done. the first refresh correctly stopped before writing because later Git-backed binding changes had no generic carrier event. the separately approved observer, independently reviewed and committed at `7a15f736b`, records the exact current state once as recovered revision 3 at 2026-10-06T15:20:21+04:00. the later actual guarded refresh is completed revision 4 at 2026-10-06T15:21:02+04:00, explicitly linked to that observation. strict admission accepts all sixteen routes with canonical digest `19757c9cb6e5977f5193e5b2fcf5fccee0efabb923a7fee7f99bac43d820bc98`; no binding event is pending. historical Journal prefixes and installed N are unchanged. C496/C497 are resolved; no stale-history guard was bypassed. fresh N9 dispatch and all remaining Release gates are still required and not yet claimed.

fresh N9 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N9` was then actually dispatched through MCP under the refreshed sixteen-route admission. source delivery and compilation completed. its complete Unit gate failed with exit 1 after 816.0929900840056 seconds: 1,925 reported testcases, 16 failures, 57 errors and zero skipped. terminal interrupted Action/Step/Workflow receipts are recorded, with no pending event; the saved recording-pending execution-stop checkpoint is not a current recording gap. no candidate image, promotion or retirement occurred. CA-P-1782's nine independent source/fixture repair lanes and CA-C-498 now own this bounded frontier. complete local acceptance, refresh the exact source pins through the approved guarded path, and use a fresh N10; do not replay failed N9. installed N stays immutable.

fresh N10 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N10` followed accepted local N9 repairs and the recorded guarded revision-5 binding refresh. delivery and compilation completed, but the Unit executor reached its code-only 900-second deadline after 934.4613934169975 seconds. no complete JUnit report was returned; receipt executed_tests=0 is a validated-report count, not evidence that no tests ran. terminal interrupted Run receipts are recorded. CA-P-1792 and CA-C-499 own a finite, source-sealed Unit-budget repair: canonical default 3600 seconds, Framework Instance override, hard maximum 7200 seconds, and no reduction of tests or later gates. seven distinct source, implementation, review, preparation and closure lanes are assigned. installed N remains unchanged; preserve N10 without replay and admit a fresh N11 only after source/code acceptance.

fresh N11 `release-epic-resume-20261006-N11` was MCP-enqueued after independently accepted source/code repairs, 147 passing focused tests and recorded guarded binding revision 6. it stopped at Step 3 with release-copy-predecessor-mismatch before delivery, compilation or Unit execution. all fourteen actual Run records are sealed, with no pending Journal recording; installed N remains unchanged. CA-P-1793/CA-C-500 own independent code, actual-tree, authority and fixture diagnosis. preserve N11 without replay, retain unproven delivery files, and admit a fresh N12 only after safe predecessor ownership is accepted. the longer Unit budget is implemented but not yet proved sufficient by a complete fresh gate.

the Operator approved CA-P-1780's guarded binding refresh: update R1882/M339/E582/D576 first, independently review and implement the narrow private capability, then publish its exact source-derived refresh with canonical Journal evidence. preserve the fifteen non-Release routes, current Release route, query admissions and registry authority. installed N and historical Runs remain unchanged. fresh Release dispatch still uses MCP and all required gates.

The former sixteen-Workflow scope is retained below as a reference. Current required membership is only the six Workflows and supporting Docker HTTP capability listed above; the others are deferred:

1. Create Atom.
2. Update Atom.
3. Replace Atom.
4. Change Atom Status for any Atom and Content Role, including Archive as a shortcut rather than a duplicate Workflow.
5. Create Scope Unit.
6. Rename Scope Unit.
7. Move Scope Unit.
8. Remove Scope Unit.
9. Implementation Workflow.
10. Revert Changes.
11. Build Entities Graph.
12. Build Terms Graph.
13. Build Applicable Methodology.
14. Find and Fetch Artifacts (Markdown carriers).
15. Find and Fetch Journal Events.
16. Release Version, including project-local ca Skill installation without hooks.

Build Applicable Methodology is the only required Projection Workflow in this first cut. The two graph builders remain reusable deferred implementations. A generic Rebuild Projections entrypoint is not an additional first-cut deliverable.

Validation, Relation checks, approval gates and journaling remain required supporting behavior where used by the retained Workflows, not additional standalone Workflows. Preserve the current identity rule: an Update requiring a Summary change hands off to Replace. Change Status resolves the applicable current status model rather than hardcoding one Content Role. The retained Implementation and Applicable Methodology paths preserve their existing permission, source/currentness, conflict/approval and evidence boundaries. Deferred structural-change and Revert contracts remain unchanged for later use.

The two deferred query Workflows retain their read-only contracts for a later milestone:

- Artifact queries filter any Markdown frontmatter property and any heading/section property, including `#`, `##`, and deeper headings. Return Artifact IDs by default; fetch only caller-selected properties/sections, such as Claims, when requested.
- Journal queries filter canonical Event fields. Return Event IDs by default; fetch only caller-selected fields or full Events when requested.
- Both use basic SQL-WHERE-style equality, inequality/NOT, and `IN`, with unambiguous boolean combinations. Return bounded, truthful coverage/pagination and invalid-filter diagnostics; do not evaluate arbitrary SQL/code or infer identities from filenames.
- Preserve the caller's requested property/status selection and do not fetch credentials/secrets or create mutation authority. The canonical Events Journal remains the one source, not independently maintained derived logs.
- Actual admitted Workflow/Action execution uses the single shared Run Journal support. Bind a stable query-source snapshot; the query's own execution records must not mutate or enlarge that captured result set. Preview is non-dispatching, and Run records must describe only actual execution.

### Change Atom Status coverage

The existing selected Change Atom Status Workflow applies to any Atom and every declared Content Role, using the current applicable status whitelist and defined folder mapping. It is not an Archive-only capability and adds no separate Workflow.

- Input: an Atom reference and the requested Status. Include Draft carriers according to the current identity rules.
- Resolve the applicable Status model for the Atom's actual Content Role and specialized Type, when present, from existing authoritative methodology. Use its admitted statuses and defined Carrier folders; caller-supplied values do not create new Status authority.
- Validate the requested Status. For the same Status, return a successful no-op without changing Atom bytes or placement. For a permitted change, update the complete Carrier and required metadata, and move it to the defined destination; create the destination folder when the Delivery rules permit it.
- Preserve identity, required Revision history and source information. Report invalid or missing models, undefined statuses or folder mappings, destination collisions and affected active references truthfully. Keep Archive as a shortcut through this same Workflow.
- Use the existing Workflow/Action shared Run Journal path for actual execution, including success, no-op and failure. Verify all declared Content Roles and their admitted statuses, not only the current Requirement fixture.

CA-P-1612 owns the bounded gap-closing decomposition below. Reuse CA-O-127/129/128 and the current generic status Action; extend source resolution and proof where needed rather than authoring another Workflow, Tool or independent status registry.

### Deferred Release Version

The earlier approved automatic release path remains retained for a later milestone, not required first-cut delivery:

1. Bind the selected next Version, exact source revision and release notes.
2. Deliver a full Methodology source copy to root `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`.
3. Compile Applicable Methodology from those sources. Bind the compiled package delivery and the Methodology consumed under `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework` to the same accepted source and Version. Preserve the upstream authoring sources; installed copies do not independently redefine authority.
4. Run the full declared test suite and retain its result. Failed or incomplete required gates prevent release promotion.
5. Install the full declared Framework package into `.caprmedio_runtime`, including Methodology, Engine, Tools, applications, MCP, Skills and their required packaged resources; it is not only an Engine installation.
6. Install the project-local `ca` Skill without hooks, using the reviewed project-local client target. Preserve unrelated Skills, settings, authoring sources and Journals.
7. Rebuild the Docker image for the selected Version, then verify the actual installed package, MCP and new image. Source/mock tests and image build alone do not prove this gate.
8. Only after successful verification, retire the exact prior image when no container or required rollback reference needs it. No broad pruning or forced image removal.

The first working vertical cut establishes a frozen Version N that builds and tests N+1. A release Run binds the executing N implementation and Methodology separately from the candidate N+1 sources/package. Changes being built do not silently redefine the running Workflow. Promote the candidate only after its required gates pass; retain N as the working runtime and rollback point until then.

CA-P-1620 retains ownership of deferred source-first release authoring/review, implementation and actual-release verification. Its full gates remain unchanged whenever that Workflow is selected. Existing runtime bindings and exact source maintenance may still support retained MCP capabilities without executing Release Version. This first-cut Plan does not execute a release, retire an image or claim all sixteen routes verified.

### Run journaling

Every Workflow Run and every Action Run must be journaled, including standalone Actions, nested invocation lineage, failed or canceled Runs, and successful no-op outcomes. Retain the Run identifiers, governing definition, parent Run/Step references where applicable, input references, start, terminal outcome, results, and actual change/evidence references. Do not put secrets in the Journal.

Use the authoritative Events Journal as the single event source; Artifact Change Log and Process Execution Log are derived views, not independently maintained competing Journals. Journal failures must be reported truthfully; an unpersisted event or Run is never claimed journaled or complete. Functional verification must prove both Workflow-level and Action-level records, failure paths, lineage, and reconstructable results.

Canonical Journal carriers use the single Project-local `.caprmedio_<project name>/_journal/` root. Canonical persisted Projection carriers use `.caprmedio_<project name>/_projection/` by default, including graphs and derived log views. Applicable Methodology is the Operator-selected exception: retain its canonical Atom Projection role folders at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/`, beside the unchanged `000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/` source folder. Its previously proposed move into `_projection/APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/` is withdrawn. The extra untracked copy is not another canonical authority and remains untouched pending scoped reconciliation. Release Version also delivers source/compiled package copies at the Operator-selected release/runtime destinations; these remain bound derived deliveries, not competing authoring or Journal authority. Runtime locks, receipts, pending recording and disposable stages remain ephemeral runtime state. Preserve historical event bytes and sealed recovery context during relocation; do not create duplicate canonical Journal or Projection authority.

### Projection behavior

- Deferred: Build Entities Graph from current authoritative Entity declarations and properties, retaining source traceability.
- Deferred: Build Terms Graph from current authoritative Term declarations and their own Relation Types, retaining source traceability.
- Build Applicable Methodology from the selected Core Meta-Model, installed Extensions, and Project Configuration. Preserve original Atom relations, detect conflicts, and require Operator approval before source corrections.
- All three outputs are derived Projections, not new sources of truth. Rebuilding them does not silently rewrite source authority. Report incomplete coverage, source conflicts, and stale or inaccessible inputs rather than claiming a complete Projection.

### Scope amendment and retained history

The latest explicit Operator scope replaces the former all-sixteen delivery and comprehensive container/audit closure requirement. Required functional and Docker coverage now includes the six retained Workflows, the supporting paths they actually use and the actual localhost HTTP MCP container path. Image construction alone is insufficient. Deferred branches remain unfinished later-milestone work and do not block this first-cut closure.

Keep the completed harvest, reconciliation, five additional authored Actions, layout repairs and their evidence. They remain available history and reusable sources; they do not create extra delivery obligations. No further harvest or broad reconciliation campaign is required. Existing child Plans must be rebound to this scope before execution; historical or unrelated leaves remain truthfully classified and are excluded from the required decomposition, not reported Done.

CA-P-1131's legacy authoring-bundle closure and CA-C-410's directory-rename failure are outside the required decomposition after this amendment. Their unresolved physical placement is preserved, not bypassed or claimed fixed. Remove their obsolete gates on the newly scoped source review; review of every source actually used by the selected Workflows remains required.

The historical evidence window is [2026-09-04 05:54:15 +0400, 2026-10-04 05:54:15 +0400). Later explicit Operator corrections in this session amend this Plan without shifting that historical cutoff. The latest explicit Operator input overrides earlier input within its authorized scope; Project Principles remain higher authority. Plan creation is not evidence that the harvest or implementations have been executed.

### Operator-closed harvest

The Operator directed: stop harvesting and continue this Epic. The admitted corpus contains 102 completed packets covering 5,463 of 13,011 session records: 4,504 PRIMARY records and 959 worker records. The remaining 7,548 records are outside further harvesting for this Epic. Interrupted CA-P-1325 / CA-A-1043 is preserved as partial evidence and contributes no completed coverage. Context records do not increase coverage.

CA-P-1118 and its unfinished harvest descendants are canceled, not Done. CA-P-1118 is removed from this Epic's required decomposition and its harvest gates are removed. Completed harvest results remain optional evidence for the selected Workflows. The current scope still requires source review, RMED, implementation, scoped functional Docker coverage, Run journaling, and closure evidence.

### Governing inputs and destinations

- Current Operator Goal: create and evolve a working CAPRMEDIO Framework; re-read the live Goal carrier before autonomous decisions.
- Project-local active authority and all active Project Principles first; applicable methodology authority next; engine-local RMED thereafter. Current source revisions, not this summary, govern exact distinctions and tiers.
- Authoritative methodology sources: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources`. Reusable, project-independent Operations belong to `001_CORE_META_MODEL`; caprmedio-specific Operations belong to `003_PROJECT_CONFIGURATION`. Reconciliation must record each adopted Operation's destination before authoring. The applicable-methodology projection is derived and never the authoring authority.
- PROGRAMMATIC authority: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC`; delivery: `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC`.
- PROMPTS authority: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/202_FEATURE_AGENTIC/202_FEATURE_PROMPTS`; delivery: `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/202_AGENTIC/202_PROMPTS`.
- R = required implementation outcomes/results; M = construction technique for implementation or tests; E = assurance policy/acceptance/test cases; D = delivery/carriers. Use current active source authority to resolve exact applicability and local tiers.
- Reuse the existing orchestrator, MCP, tools, prompts and Docker packaging baseline where appropriate. Bind each selected Workflow to its current source definition, Actions, implementation and functional evidence; do not invent duplicate Workflows for shared infrastructure.
- Keep valuable extracted decisions, manifest/frontiers, review results and execution evidence in governed Analysis/Plan/Journal carriers with source references. Disposable intermediate packets may live in `.caprmedio_tmp` but cannot be the only retained completion evidence.
- Docker coverage includes every selected Workflow and its actual Action, Tool, prompt, MCP and runtime execution path. Runtime input/project-data mounts and explicitly provided external services/credentials are allowed by their governed contracts; baked secrets, undeclared host implementation mounts and host-only packages are not. Local build/run is in scope; publishing images, deploying services, or changing account authorization requires separate authority.

### Composite task sequence

Authoring disposition: the earlier Plan files retain their independent reviews. Newly added or amended branches require their own saved pre-execution review; creation alone does not prove review or execution. The Operator explicitly authorizes mechanical Git commits for this Epic without the save Tool; if Git cannot commit, skip that commit, retain the unfinished save disposition, and continue independent ready work. CA-C-292 remains an active save-Tool defect, but repairing it is not a prerequisite for this authorized Git path. Record actual commit results without claiming Tool-generated Journal provenance. The stricter body-layout disposition for source conflict CA-C-290 is nonblocking for this Epic's preparation.

- CA-P-1118: Canceled harvest stage; retained completed evidence supplies the following stage.
- CA-P-1119: Bind, author or reuse, and independently review the original thirteen selected source Workflows and their required Actions.
- CA-P-1120: Specify and independently review their PROGRAMMATIC capabilities, including all-Run journaling and Projection construction.
- CA-P-1121: Specify and independently review only the PROMPTS capabilities required by these Workflows.
- CA-P-1122: Implement and functionally verify the selected capabilities from reviewed RMED.
- CA-P-1123: Verify all selected execution paths in Docker, including MCP and reused dependencies.
- CA-P-1124: Verify the six-Workflow and Docker HTTP coverage matrix, actual Run Journal evidence and scoped traceability, then close the first cut.
- CA-P-1520: Deferred standalone query delivery and its remaining acceptance; preserve existing implementation and evidence.
- CA-P-1612: Complete the existing Change Atom Status capability for every Content Role using current status/folder authority, then prove the resolved model and execution behavior independently.
- CA-P-1620: Deferred automated Release Version, upgrade and prior-image disposition. Keep its formal release requirements unchanged; bounded runtime source-binding maintenance may remain a prerequisite for retained MCP use.
- CA-P-1757: Required actual localhost HTTP MCP Docker proof with existing authenticated transport and stdio compatibility.
- CA-P-1655: Final code/RMED/O review only for the six retained Workflows and their used supporting paths, including Docker HTTP; this scoped review blocks CA-P-1124 and first-cut closure.

The existing composites retain completed history but their current required membership is rebound to the first cut. Classify unfinished descendants explicitly as required supporting work or deferred later-milestone work before closure; retain their truthful statuses rather than marking excluded work Done. Query, graph, structural mutation, Revert and automated release acceptance are not required merely because old child Plans remain under the Epic. Create only necessary bounded leaves and reuse accepted implementations and evidence; preparation and file presence do not prove completion.

### Execution controls

- Each task/subtask has exactly one Plan Markdown file. A composite owns its same-stem directory of child files; the Epic's folder has its mandatory same-stem governing file beside it.
- Each executable leaf has one assigned AI Agent and a work estimate of <=15 minutes. Before execution bind exact input evidence, governing revisions, target files, required result, functional verification and any decision disposition. If the estimate exceeds fifteen minutes, decompose further before execution; never silently expand a leaf.
- After every completed task/subtask, review actual results and current authority, then update every affected next dependent Plan before it executes. Add BLOCKS edges for new remainder/repair/re-review leaves; navigation order is not a dependency. A composite cannot be Done until all required child/remainder work is Done.
- Complete this Epic autonomously through its required implementation, verification and final review. When uncertain, check the active Operator Goal, Project Principles and current authority, choose the best authorized in-scope option, and create a C/Question recording the uncertainty, considered options, selected choice and reason. Continue without waiting for an Operator answer; uncertainty alone is not a reason to stop or leave required work unfinished. Inherit the 90% confidence threshold for recording uncertainty, not as a request-to-pause gate. Actual permission, runtime, evidence or authority blockers still postpone only the affected work and never justify a bypass or false completion.
- Every issue encountered becomes one appropriately typed Concern at its narrowest owning Scope Unit: Problem for blockers/failures, Question for unresolved choices, Conflict for incompatible governing claims. The Concern owns concern_about to the directly affected task/entity and records evidence, impact and disposition. Do not substitute ephemeral chat notes for C atoms.
- On permission/runtime/evidence blockers, create a C/Problem, retain truthful unfinished task state and frontier, postpone the task and execute another independent ready task. Do not bypass its BLOCKS prerequisites, permission denial, or missing authority.
- Prefer functional, integration, E2E and canary verification. Use unit tests only where they add necessary isolated proof; do not couple acceptance to implementation structure.
- Preserve unrelated changes. Use mechanical Git commits for this Epic's changes under the Operator's explicit exception; do not invoke COMMIT_CHANGE_SET or make its repair a prerequisite. If Git cannot commit, skip that commit and retain a truthful save frontier. Retain required execution Journal evidence and append-only history; do not fabricate save-Tool receipts.

## Details

### Retained pre-amendment execution frontier

### Retained earlier restored execution frontier

The latest Operator instruction supersedes the first-cut deferrals below. Resume the existing P1620 release chain, P1616 all-role status proof, P1527-P1529 query proof, P1713/P1716 recovery, and P1655 then P1124 final closure. Exact prior-image retirement remains conditional on successful promotion and absence of container/rollback references; retain a required image with a truthful disposition, never force-delete it. Each restored lane uses the existing accepted source contract; no new harvest or broad methodology review is authorized.

The N5 gate and current audit repairs are tracked in P1755-P1772 with C483-C490 at their owning Scope Units. Root owns Git, runtime publication, Docker image changes and actual MCP dispatch. Independent workers have exclusive code/test scopes. Test doubles, source checks and protocol fixtures remain clearly distinct from actual release/runtime proof.

### Historical first-cut snapshots — superseded by the restored frontier

The Operator directed cutting or postponing work to reach a first working release. Keep the required Unit, candidate-image/canary, Docker/MCP, Full Gate and Journal proofs. Postpone automatic prior-image retirement, expanded crash/restart recovery testing, the broad all-sixteen audit and additional edge-case expansion. Retain N as rollback and preserve the existing later cleanup/recovery capabilities. A first-release caller may stop after verified promotion; an unexecuted retirement Step is deferred, not retired or completed. The deferred work and full Epic closure remain unfinished.

Newest local evidence: 7874fc864 saves the private Candidate E2E gate and byte-backed golden tests. Its complete module passed 11/11 after retained failed/malformed/empty JUnit was fixed; narrow D582#10 review accepted that final repair. Unit partition/driver/admission tests subsequently passed 20/20, and the Full Gate's seven focused tests passed. Consumer/source-admission integration remains under verification. Docker now connects from this session to Engine 29.8.2; the earlier denied/unavailable socket observations below are historical. Read-only first-N preparation finds a conflict-free current source assessment but a stale canonical compiled tree: 77 missing, five extra and 958 changed output carriers. No current N, project-local Skill, real candidate image, installation, promotion or image removal is claimed by this local evidence.

The latest continuation saves the bootstrap proof implementation in b790a3fd0 after independent compiler/bootstrap source acceptance and a combined 50-case run (32.933 seconds). P1732-P1738 are Done for this local slice; P1739 and parent P1714 remain Active for actual compilation/image/install/Skill/Journal proof. The fresh direct Docker CLI probe still returns socket permission denied; no image or runtime publication is claimed.

The Operator approved the separate bounded host E2E executor. Its RMED, private-driver grammar and configurable defaults are accepted in c450b1b45; C476@2 records approval and unfinished implementation. P1740 with children P1741-P1749 owns the bounded executor, sealed Harness bindings, phase map, consumer/admission integration and independent local acceptance; P1744/P1745 are now decomposed further into P1750-P1754. Existing Suite RMED phase amendments are accepted in 7d14bebd9. P1743 is Done and C477 resolved; the independently accepted Operations graph and original full predecessor archives are saved in 1c159f18d. Root saved the bounded proof/task frontier in ebacdd1ee and the context/Driver/Harness/phase-map code in 5e0dfee93 after independent source acceptance. Root's actual verification passed 24 combined context/Driver/phase-map cases, five Runtime image-binding cases and two actual MCP transport cases. C479/C480 are resolved for strict context admission and duplicate testcase refusal. The private gate's capability/settings/predecessor repairs have bounded static acceptance but still need expanded golden behavior and explicit D582#10 Harness metadata; C478 remains Active. Canonical Methodology is still stale and Docker access remains denied even after the Operator recreated its socket. Actual full-suite execution, source-frontier rebind, first-runtime installation and promotion remain mandatory. These newest facts supersede older development snapshots below, not their actual historical events.

Historical disposition: the Operator temporarily deferred queue item #5, the final all-sixteen-Workflow code-versus-RMED/O review, coverage audit and Epic closure. The latest continuation restores that work. CA-P-1655 and CA-P-1124 remain unfinished until their actual gates pass.

The latest 2026-10-05 continuation supersedes the older snapshots below. P1715 is Done: c1a4749e2 actually published and independently observed the source-admitted sixteen-route successor, with completed canonical Event journal:release-manifest:81cf4fac9b9087e14d451502fa1be473c664eea1f7f4b74e1032ba1b084449a7. Physical Carrier SHA-256 is 1eabfd2f1a0df45ae0df2ff4b2221ebe557ef1f520a990ef6d10f542259d6723; the canonical digest is 48a03709ba64113b007893bf92886be447a57be1ce5b324056c8f18eab7854e7. Durable recovery, source admission and immutable-suite executor development are saved in 88e6546d8. Earlier focused recovery/provider and source-admission results are not actual Docker Release acceptance.

The Operator stopped PID 61257. Root then started a host worker that emitted structured v5 readiness and subsequently stopped only that owned foreground worker cleanly after code changed. The old v3 Base Revise Run remains ENQUEUED and was not replayed or migrated. Actual Docker compiler Run release-methodology-reconcile-20261005-1805 reached its first Action but ended interrupted_pending without effects: frozen host compiler parameters did not match /project. Its six canonical Workflow/Step/Action Journal records are saved in 877a669bf. Local trusted-root repair 684b87f0e passes four focused tests, but the Docker worker has not loaded it. A new freshly admitted Run is required after an authorized runtime rebuild/restart and source reassessment; scheduler SUCCESS is not Workflow success.

P1722-P1726 and P1727-P1731 are Done for the bounded complete-suite driver, private current-control context, focused tests and independent integration review. Their accepted source packet is saved in b7d44ccfa and implementation in 689dd212f. The fixed CLI, exact schema-2 envelope and actual per-case reports preserve the candidate-inventory and sixteen-route contracts. Twelve golden driver tests and 34 context/timing/checkpoint/handoff/executor/retained-image tests pass. Seventeen intentional fixture payloads no longer match real-test discovery; no production exclusion was added. C475 is resolved for that bounded design/implementation, not for actual full-suite execution.

P1714 and P1717/P1721 remain Active. A complete Framework N selector/package and project-local ca Skill are still absent, and canonical Applicable Methodology remains stale. First-N source authoring is being repaired to require compiler-current canonical output and actual complete-package bootstrap-image build/inspect/canary proof; matching labels alone are insufficient. C476 records another source-confirmed prerequisite: the three mandatory Docker E2E modules cannot execute inside the existing closed, read-only, network-disabled suite environment. Their skips are non-passing. A separately governed E2E-capable gate needs accepted RMED before implementation; no host Docker socket mount, hidden exclusion or permission relaxation is authorized by this Plan.

The Operator directed retaining test fixture directories, so cleanup alone is not a blocker. Direct Docker socket access and isolated Release atomic directory publication remain denied. No actual complete-runtime installation, Skill activation, new image, image removal or Release promotion is claimed. These external gates and the deferred final audit remain open; current development evidence does not close them.

The following paragraphs are historical snapshots, not newer completion assertions.

Latest bounded result: f2ba6c494 resolves the image override review finding with a shared strict immutable-ID resolver; independent review accepts it and root reruns five pure cases. Root also reruns four guarded-registration and two hook-payload cases, plus three existing pure provider serialization cases. Suite candidate-binding/N-carrier and private provider/retirement repairs remain working-tree code with fixture verification pending, not accepted complete implementation. Recovery review established that saved native results omit preflight/type identity; no unsafe rehydrator was created. A typed closed checkpoint in the existing shared progress path is required before restart continuation. Directory-cleanup C449 remains the real test blocker; no canonical manifest, installed runtime, Skill or Docker image was changed by this continuation.

Parallel continuation saved 194dee472 (truthful task/environment frontier), 85a80d698 (explicit Methodology delivery destination), 3eec8cffb (guarded Release registration, four pure tests) and 28f5e572c (hook-free ca payload admission, two pure tests). d7e1c53de preserved explicit image selection with four pure tests, but independent review found arbitrary tag overrides too broad; a strict immutable-ID repair is in progress. The live canonical manifest is still fifteen routes, and no image was built, promoted or retired. Provider effect-reference and retirement-outcome repairs remain saved but fixture-unverified. Suite candidate/N-preservation and typed recovery prerequisites are still being implemented. Public effect-free Release refusal is intentional under D560/D572 until successor admission, not itself an authority conflict.

The latest am-default probes permit Docker inventory and temporary-file removal, but deny temporary-directory removal. The Operator directed leaving the empty probe untouched. C449 remains Active for fixture cleanup; no tests are weakened or relabelled passing. Ten independent subagents now continue bounded Release implementation and source/code reviews in parallel. P1712's three fixture-root changes pass independent static review without weakening production checks or cleanup; runtime verification remains pending.

The latest Operator input retains Applicable Methodology at its original framework location. D550@3, D326@15 and the five Project Structure delivery bindings now express that exception; compiler path support and all40 focused compiler/selected/expansion tests pass, saved in 2cebdbabd. Project Settings join the freshness snapshot; explicit Release child output is preserved. C447's denied move is withdrawn rather than executed or bypassed. Historical migration evidence remains unchanged, and legacy-manifest accounting remains separate.

Docker API access and the declared host dependency environment now work. C449@3 records the current remaining filesystem blocker: Release fixture directory cleanup raises EPERM. P1710 saves sixteen focused provider tests, with three pure boundary cases passing; the fixture-based run is not a pass. P1712 corrects macOS /tmp versus /private/tmp normalization and adds a root-equality regression; static checks pass, but fixture verification is still blocked. Capacity interruption C468 is cleared by a normal subagent return, not by a model override. All source/mock, private-provider and static review results remain distinct from fresh-image, shared Journal, durable restart and actual sixteenth-route acceptance.

P1711 independently accepts the pinned exact-image-retirement delta at96% with no blocking code finding. Its review does not rerun or relabel previous mock tests. Durable same-intent recording reconciliation, current host regressions, real image proof and complete Release dispatch remain unfinished. The deleted057792 image is not usable evidence; P1600-P1604 require a newly bound immutable image before execution.

Current checkpoint supersedes every earlier snapshot: the autonomous rule is in force, with chosen uncertainties recorded as C466/C467 rather than Operator questions. P1699 independently accepts the Draft Update repair98%; P1685/P1677/P1662/P1637 and current P1638 development review are Done, and C460 is resolved. Exact owned staged native code passes23 cases without including external legacy-migration changes. P1698, P1693 and P1700 complete retained image verification, actual disposable selector/Skill promotion recovery and the strict effect-free Tool boundary; they do not prove a real Release.

P1701 composes all ten Release phases with14 focused tests. P1702 removes the suite's hidden installation prerequisite with21 suite cases and37 image/14 promotion regressions; fresh suite execution precedes O175 staging without hidden package/Skill creation, resolving C467. C466's approved retention source is now D573@2, independently accepted99% after the successful-evidence ambiguity repair. P1706/P1709 bind and independently accept D572@4/P1622's exact amended frontier at98%, with21 RMED/38 unique source pins and15 admission tests; the production fifteen-route manifest remains untouched. P1707 implements conditional exact retirement and P1708 shared native provider integration in parallel. Public sixteenth registration, durable restart/recording recovery, final code-versus-RMED/O review and actual full-suite/new-image/queue/MCP Release gates remain required. C447/C449 are unchanged permission/evidence boundaries, not bypassed. The Epic remains Active.

Current autonomous continuation supersedes the snapshots below: P1690 repaired atomic history consumption and missing-Draft recovery; P1683/P1684/P1690 are Done after independent acceptance at97%. P1694 finishes head-first native promotion retry with eight promotion and fourteen status cases passing; independent P1638 still rejects Draft Update accepting an unrelated retained head, and P1699 now owns that pre-write repair. P1685 and its native integration parents remain Active until that current finding is fixed and reviewed.

Release preparatory implementation now includes full source delivery, bound full-suite execution, shared persistent source inventory, exact image-input sealing, image build/canary evidence, additive source admission and loader validation. P1698 adds selector-independent retained image-artifact verification with twenty-five mock-image cases passing. P1693 is integrating that reader into observed Framework/Skill promotion and recovery; P1697 exact prior-image retirement follows it. Native Release entrypoint/providers, sixteenth public registration and real full-suite/new-image/MCP/queue Release proof remain required. Local tests and mock image evidence are not full Release acceptance. C447/C449 boundaries remain unchanged.

Latest verified frontier supersedes the older snapshots below. The Operator requires autonomous completion: choose the best authorized in-scope option, record uncertainty in C/Question, and continue without waiting; genuine permission/evidence boundaries still cannot be bypassed. Source-derived qualified status resolution and the eight shared source-driven cases are accepted. D446@7 binds same-Atom demotion by removing its own identifier. P1638 rejected two Draft-origin substitutions not covered by earlier passing cases. P1675/P1676/P1681 complete independently accepted D568@5/D570@4/D569@5 target-bound history and non-consuming pending finalization. P1683/P1684's thirteen focused passes were followed by independent REJECT at98%: concurrent finalizers duplicated consumption and terminal recovery failed after Draft removal. Those two Tasks are reopened; C462/P1690 own the bounded repair. P1685's Create/Update/demotion wiring is partial until supported pending lookup and exact native retry are complete. P1637/P1662/P1677 remain Active. C459 records the chosen design, C460 the original native gap. P1647 remains Done for independent shared-status scope; current W01-W04 pins are rebound, other routes unchanged.

Release source authoring P1621/P1627-P1629 and corrected P1622 acceptance are complete. P1650/P1672 independently accept the actual compiler frontier separately from the canonical-tree digest; P1680 proves real compiler-to-stager propagation. P1673/P1674/P1679/P1682 complete the repaired additive source packet: D572@3 owns the closed complete pin record; R1847@7 delegates it; O164/O165/O166/O173@2 preserve child-only materialization. Final source review accepts at99%. P1686's twelve full-copy/refusal/recovery cases and compiler/pipeline regressions pass. P1687 implements additive admission validation and P1688 the bound suite phase in parallel with lifecycle wiring. Native Release providers/registration, full-suite, installation, fresh-image and actual Release execution remain unfinished. C447 denied Projection relocation and C449 immutable-image/MCP runtime proof remain genuine gates. No release promotion, project Skill replacement, image retirement or denied-operation bypass has occurred.

P1605 diagnosed a stale live discovery generation and absent query discovery bindings; P1607/P1609 repaired explicit bindings and registry-derived availability. Live reload changed generation from 1be08a172092c071a5412fb0958dba3a2cacf353276618cb644a2a4ed350c04f to 677e2f34b80b3f6aa3637dcedea7cd0b8af05b633666fdfe2ec632c5d0d727b6. Actual MCP discovery now returns both query Tools as MCP-available, 49 diagnostics and no projected CA-O-159/162 ambiguity. Client schema refresh remains unconfirmed; this is not fresh-image execution. P1608's independent source acceptance repairs the query test's Projection-write blind spot. Subsequent Engine changes are not included in P1596's earlier immutable image.

P1610 corrected native Artifact query/shared Run authority; P1611 rejected its inherited snapshot-before-Run statement. P1617 repaired O158@4 and independent P1618 accepted the current exact eight-source frontier in 88405e40e. Independently accepted P1619 rebound W14 to P1618@1/O158@4 in 4d1b6d254, preserving the other fourteen routes, W15 admission and registry. Eight focused development-worker tests passed in 14.8 seconds, including rejection of rehashed old P1532 with current O158. This is source/development admission, not immutable-image, queue or client-schema acceptance; C449/P1604 retain those separate gates. The earlier native fifteen-route acceptance remains historical evidence for its bound bytes, not a current revised-source dispatch claim. Live discovery is resolved separately as C450.

 P1589 now accepts all fifteen selected native contracts in the development worker: the strict W01-W08/W11-W15 suite passed, W09 passed 3/3 and W10 passed 2/2. The proofs include actual native effects, frozen inputs, graph/progress consistency and per-Run shared Journal lineage. W09 is explicitly mock-not-live-llm. Native success is not immutable-image, MCP or queue-process acceptance.

P1566's rejected Revert candidate is retained separately from the accepted P1574/P1581 repair and P1584 actual native route proof; C446 is resolved. P1567 caches stable approved carriers, supplies a valid pre-Run Journal directory and uses explicit container-visible paths before preview. P1576/P1586 bind structural cutover to actual sealed predecessor receipts. P1592 finalizes W13 derived progress only after actual recording; the raw native pending_recording result remains truthful. P1588 accepts P1591's trusted-root workspace overlap guard. P1597 accepts explicit bounded Docker mock injection without widening mounts or changing the live default. No old harvest resumes.

P1547 accepts both native query Tools and the sole parser after repaired adversarial snapshots and truthful consumption diagnostics; P1525/P1526 are Done for native Tool scope. P1543 accepts the fifteen-route MCP source, and P1552 accepts D521@5's exact two-frontier admission. Neither source registration nor core tests count as runtime/image proof.

P1596 built fresh immutable image sha256:057792974dc2d81f84f99dee5535a44d5ee30513b03f6154381d99aa0bd558cd from unchanged Engine context 811cfd014de92cc407cb1ae825d4054a30eb7407274d26b8098ae149bceed063. P1593's harness retains the verified MCP 2.3 API, fresh connections, exact structured output and strict W01-W15/J01-J08 gates. The image build is not functional proof. P1600-W01-W05, P1601-W06-W10, P1602-W11-W15 and P1603 safety cases remain unexecuted: the host test environment is unusable and declared dependency provisioning hit filesystem rename EPERM. C449 preserves this new blocker; no permission bypass or stale-worker substitution occurred. P1604's query-specific actual-MCP remainder remains Active. P1594/P1595/P1598/P1599 record focused native, filter and consumer coverage without closing P1527/P1528/P1529.

Carrier cutover is partial, not complete: 102 registered historical view Projections moved in 615b49250 with 55,288,394 byte-identical predecessor bytes, and P1556 saves the durable map. The first Applicable Methodology role-directory move was denied EPERM. Project C447/P1549 retain that blocked remainder; C443 is now the separate PROGRAMMATIC legacy-consumer issue. No retry, alternative move, rebasing or rollback occurred. All 963 original source links remain valid and the distinct legacy Engine manifest remains untouched. The earlier 337-file Journal byte-preserving cutover remains verified. Independent ready implementation continues while denied work remains unfinished.

The following paragraphs are retained historical frontier snapshots, not current completion assertions.

Centralized carrier cutover: CA-D-549/CA-D-550 establish `_journal/` and `_projection/`. The earlier directory rename was denied and was not bypassed. Current readback now finds `_journal/` and no old `work_journal/`; root compared all 337 tracked historical Journal files against their Git predecessor bytes and verified all 337 identical, with no missing or changed files. The canonical MCP manifest exists in `_projection/` and its original-thirteen current source pins loaded successfully. Remaining cutover: persisted graph/signature outputs and Applicable Methodology carriers still use old physical locations; relocate only the registered derived outputs and rebase their source references before whole-cutover/image acceptance. Source authority stays in the framework folder and runtime locks/receipts/pending records stay ephemeral. This readback is not a claim that all persisted Projections are migrated.

The original thirteen-capability implementation branch is unchanged. Required source definitions and independent source reviews are complete for those thirteen; P1119/P1132 are physically Done for that scope. No harvesting or broad source audit remains. P1484–1492 supplied eighty-two native PROGRAMMATIC/PROMPTS specification carriers and the original Docker acceptance portfolio. P1493–P1500 reviews and their bounded corrections have been accepted; P1120/P1121 and the initial implementation preflights are Done.

The two query source packets are accepted: P1532 accepts the repaired Artifact packet; P1533 rejected a remaining Journal absence-semantics conflict; P1534 repaired it and P1535 accepted the final Journal source pins. Workers returned both query Tools and the shared filter. Root's combined development-worker suites passed 15 Artifact/filter and 8 Journal tests; P1544 now independently checks their actual contract coverage. Tool code/test counts alone do not close P1525/P1526 or prove shared Run/MCP/image behavior. P1542/P1543 author and independently accept the necessary additive fifteen-route MCP source contract before P1527 integration.

P1510–P1519 bind the test-first implementation packets. P1536 completed Implementation Step-specific input handoff, and P1539 completed native W01–W08 golden inputs with actual disposable-Project adapter effects. P1540's manifest-based repeat visit identities retain one failing real shared-recorder test; P1541 repairs duplicate Workflow definition bindings without weakening the Journal. Implementation Agent startup, governed Revert service startup, compilation approval/correction paths, remaining golden inputs, actual all-route queue/MCP dispatch, and fresh immutable-image execution remain unproven. Original-thirteen implementation continues independently of query source admission. Final coverage and Epic closure require all fifteen Workflows, actual effects and truthful every-Run Journal evidence.

### Accepted first-cut closure

The approved six-Workflow frontier is complete: Create, Update, Replace, Change Status, Implementation and Build Applicable Methodology. CA-P-1655@10 records the accepted source/code/RMED/O review, native lifecycle/composition and all-role Status proof, six-route Docker/stdio execution and actual authenticated Docker HTTP execution. CA-P-1757@4 records the HTTP boundary; CA-P-1816@2 retains exact actual Run/Journal artifacts and terminal indexes. HTTP passed 14 tests in 118.565 seconds, with six completed Workflow and 18 completed Action terminals. The separate retained stdio index also has six completed Workflow and 18 completed Action terminals. W09 uses the explicit golden mock Agent, not a live LLM.

| Required record | Accepted functional boundary | Administrative Status |

The Operator explicitly instructed MCP first, then mechanical Git if it did not work. Current discovery/context was admitted, but the actual read-only orchestrator status call failed with `Docker queue call failed; inspect runtime logs; no native queue fallback`. No closure request was frozen or queued. Git closed the six file-only records but denied P1615's coupled directory rename after its file moved; that partial move was restored before committing `57ab1da71`. The Operator then ran the exact pinned Terminal handoff. Git records 603 zero-content rename entries for the six coupled pairs and their nested contents. The remaining required records now have verified Done placement and metadata; this Epic closes only the approved first cut. This is administrative authoring, not an executed status Workflow: no production Run, Event or Journal receipt is fabricated. The existing test Project Journal receipts remain the actual functional evidence.

Every remaining unfinished descendant listed below retains its original Status and bytes. These are the remaining broader obligations after the retained slices were accepted, not claims that proven shared support is unimplemented. Original-route/full-image roll-ups and comprehensive optional auditing do not become first-cut requirements through their historical nesting. The one explicitly excluded legacy authoring record remains unfinished but is not reintroduced into the required decomposition.

This closes only the Operator-selected first cut. Formal Release, all-sixteen coverage, Scope mutations, Revert, standalone queries, graph delivery, additional recovery/full-suite hardening and image retirement remain deferred and unclaimed. Installed N, canonical historical Events, unchanged binding/source authority, unrelated edits and prior failures remain preserved.

### Definition of Done

CA-P-1655 completes the scoped final code-versus-RMED/O review for the six retained Workflows and their used support paths, including Docker HTTP. Resolve blocking findings in those paths before CA-P-1124 closes the first cut.

Each retained Workflow has current reviewed definitions, located RMED/O and a working implementation with actual functional Docker/MCP evidence for its required behavior. Retained acceptance verifies truthful Workflow/Action Journal records and results, identity/history preservation, current generic status handling and applicable permission/secret/currentness boundaries. Build Applicable Methodology has source traceability, conflict/approval handling and actual rebuild/currentness evidence.

HTTP MCP actually runs inside a Docker container on localhost. Authenticated initialize/list/call, health and lifecycle checks pass; invalid credentials/Host/Origin are refused and stdio remains usable. The coverage matrix identifies actual source, implementation, container/image, Run, Action and result evidence instead of inferring success from files, build output or scheduler status.

Only the required retained/supporting child work must be Done. Every unfinished descendant is explicitly classified as retained required work or deferred work; deferred capabilities are preserved and remain unfinished for a later milestone. No all-sixteen coverage, graph/query/Revert/structural mutation delivery, automatic upgrade, old-image retirement, extra recovery hardening or comprehensive optional-code audit is claimed or required for this first cut.

Installed N, historical Runs, source/Projection/Journal provenance and unrelated changes remain preserved. No formal N-to-N+1 release or selected-runtime promotion is inferred; any such effect still requires its unchanged normative gates. Use the approved mechanical Git exception; a skipped commit has an explicit disposition, and nonblocking Concerns retain justified dispositions.
