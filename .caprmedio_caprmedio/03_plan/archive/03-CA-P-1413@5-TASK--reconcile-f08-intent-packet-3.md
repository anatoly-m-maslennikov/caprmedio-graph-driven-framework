# Summary

Reconcile F08 intent packet 3

## Objective

One assigned AI Agent, <=15-minute estimate. Reconcile the complete saved intent clauses of the 18 exact F08 entries below with current owning authority; save CA-A-1133. First actual execution clock: 2026-10-04 13:38:35 UTC; deadline 13:53:35 UTC. This packet does not execute the entire family.

### Bound inputs

CA-A-1063's closed candidate register; exact references, Markdown ordinals1-based / JSON indices0-based:

Current Operation starting owners; exact metadata does not imply semantic equivalence:

- CA-O-077 v4: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_ops/CA-O-077-CORE_META_MODEL-ACTION--reconcile-atom-properties-and-addresses-together.md`.

First-five reuse / representation receipts:

- R0080 (F13 primary; cross F08) remains assigned to CA-P-1342; reuse only its exact reviewed proposition from `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1060-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-replacement-and-lineage-preservation.md`, not whole-family acceptance.
- R0083 (F04 primary; cross F08) remains assigned to CA-P-1342; reuse only its exact reviewed proposition from `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1060-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-replacement-and-lineage-preservation.md`, not whole-family acceptance.
- R0389 (F04 primary; cross F08, F10) remains assigned to CA-P-1342; reuse only its exact reviewed proposition from `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1060-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-replacement-and-lineage-preservation.md`, not whole-family acceptance.
- Retained alias links, not new primary work: R0319 → R0314, R0341 → R0335, R0373 → R0366, R0375 → R0368. Compare any distinct qualifiers before claiming reuse.


P1117 v2, P1119 v2 and current P1130 v5, Goal v13 and all14 active Project Principles govern at inherited90% confidence. Reuse unchanged fully read controls; reread only changed authority and each actually relied-upon source. R1589 v4, R1580 v4, D479 v6 and D461 v6 govern binding/readiness/placement. Current metadata alone never establishes semantic coverage.

### Ownership, result and check

Own this leaf and `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1133-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-f08-intent-packet-3.md` only. Other Agents own adjacent children and shared parents: preserve their edits. No native/session-index harvesting, FPF execution, O/RMED/code/settings/parent/Git/Journal writes. Exact already-saved context may clarify a bound candidate under P1130 v5, not create new candidates.

Group repeated intent, but disposition every bound entry and distinct qualifier: covered, gap, rejected, or non-operational. Cite the precise current owning clause/revision and generic CORE_META_MODEL versus project-specific PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination. Existing accepted family results may be reused only after checking the selected candidate's whole intent. Do not generate one Operation or test per repeated form. Proposals are not authority or runtime proof.

Reopen the saved Analysis and check exact-reference completeness, cited coverage limits, required YAML/Analysis headings and unique owned IDs. Record the small actual verification result and original clock. Complete only this leaf, with status Done and physical D461 placement; shared family/stage stays Active. Do not expand into repeated fingerprint/control bookkeeping. If truly incomplete, preserve the exact remaining refs, not a pass.

### Actual result and verification

A1133 accounts for all eighteen exact bound refs and their full qualifiers. Current local-evidence/coverage and authorized Carrier-change owners are reused; complete Entity/Subject interpretation remains with actual RMED owners rather than a new Operation or a hidden atom_local pass. No new semantic Operation gap was retained; A1123's separate G1 still requires root's independent cross-family review. C391 records the actual O054 v5 Delivery-layout defect; existing C376/C380 remain separate. No source or later stage is declared repaired or complete.

Saved completeness/carrier proof PASS at 2026-10-04T13:49:13.924676+00:00, 638.924676 seconds from the unchanged 13:38:35 UTC start: all eighteen exact register/Plan refs, three strict unique owned carriers, proper headings/one EOF newline, original decomposition/BLOCKS and Active shared parents. Physical Done placement proof PASS at 2026-10-04T13:50:09.019022+00:00, 694.019022 seconds; exact final receipt is recorded in A1133. Final closeout clock sampled at 2026-10-04 13:51:02 UTC, 747 seconds from the unchanged start, is within the estimate. Root owns the source-layout authoring/review follow-up. P1353/P1130 and P1131/P1156 stay Active.

## Details

### Definition of Done

CA-A-1133 accounts for all18 assigned references and complete intent clauses with justified current-source/disposition/destination citations and actual saved verification. Uncertain or missing comparison falsifies Done. Other required family packets remain separately required. A minor terminal-save overrun is recorded truthfully, not disguised or treated as a new semantic task.
