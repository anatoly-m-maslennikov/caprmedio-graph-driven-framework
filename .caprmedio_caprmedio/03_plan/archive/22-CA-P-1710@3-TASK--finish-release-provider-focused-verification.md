# Summary

Finish Release provider focused verification

## Objective

Within <=8 minutes, resume P1708's capacity-interrupted partial provider and save its bounded verified frontier.

## Details

Own only selected_native_providers.py and tests/test_release_native_providers.py, preserving the existing saved partial work. Source admission P1709 is independently accepted98%; P1701 ten-phase API and P1707 conditional retirement API are ready. Finish only the current provider/context and unchanged-fifteen focused tests, correcting concrete failures. Private default image backend remains an explicitly incomplete runtime binding when None; no fake availability, second Journal writer, caller phase/executor flag or receipt. Report actual shared-recording/restart proof as unfinished if not executed. No further feature, source/Plan/Git/manifest/registry/settings/image work. If model capacity repeats, retain exact files/frontier and switch only to independent ready work, not an unauthorized model override.

## Definition of Done

Save exact code/test hashes and genuine focused result/remaining coverage, without claiming public or complete Release dispatch.

## Result

Parallel continuation repaired the private provider's effect-reference boundary: empty carrier paths and symlinks escaping the Project are rejected. Added an empty-path case and a symlink-escape case; fixture coverage remains unexecuted because directory cleanup is denied. Root reran the three pure serialization cases successfully. Current provider SHA-256 is f65c82aa54bae8e4ebe800c0973fafe75c63e616c5aba963447c3e2a1eaf7080; current test SHA-256 is da5f3b2ae02bb0abd7657eda1a3efb425833f9f03374728b7451e4ef88deee1a. This does not prove shared Journal or restart recovery; historical hashes below remain historical evidence only.

The resumed subagent returned normally; model capacity no longer prevents this bounded work. Added sixteen focused tests in tests/test_release_native_providers.py: thirteen disposable provider/admission/lineage/phase/refusal checks and three pure result conversion checks.

Three pure checks pass. The initial fourteen-test fixture run returned fourteen cleanup PermissionErrors, first under /tmp/tmpe5spxd0y/.caprmedio_install/workflow_orchestrator/runs/fixture-workflow. Assertion-body execution without an assertion failure is not a passing test when cleanup failed. C449 owns this permission boundary; no suppressed cleanup or alternate-path rerun was used.

Exact working-tree SHA-256: provider 5e92cbac42579201015c56ffaef15eb1f39ec66fbcc9a0f012c2a5d2daff95b9; new tests 08c3fe104f341f2d8763f2ac71ec1ffb3ac9259496c62dd29e37b4fc7dc37945; release_actions.py ff5be691be5ba01073ae667347ce078849e357d1c3d72aaf60c156ce31e22180; release_source_admission.py 36b86ba82dfbccbffe1f33eac23dbefa4f746db5055211f227f658aa10991228.

This Task remains Active: unchanged-fifteen integration, actual shared Journal recording, fixture-based verification, durable restart, actual image and public Release dispatch are not proven. The new tests use explicit admission/phase/tracker doubles. P1712 separately corrects macOS fixture root aliases without weakening production checks.
