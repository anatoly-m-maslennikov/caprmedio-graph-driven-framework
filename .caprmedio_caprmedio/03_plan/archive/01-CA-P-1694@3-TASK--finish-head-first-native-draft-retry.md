# Summary

Finish head-first native Draft retry

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, finish head-first native Draft retry.

## Details

Own only atom_operations.py, lifecycle_intents.py and tests/test_draft_promotion_golden.py. Current Create/Update/demotion history wiring exists, but promotion selects an ID before pending lookup. Resolve the trusted retained head first; exact pending request/head/output bindings decide recovery before fresh allocation or output preparation. Same-transition retries after partial output/finalization or old-Draft removal must reuse the one identity/output; changed requests and origin substitutions refuse. Add actual native regression cases rather than repeating the existing five happy/refusal tests. Use accepted P1690 lookup/recovery APIs without reading private files. Preserve external baseline and all other edits. Disposable dev-worker tests only, no real-repository effects, Git/source/Plan/image or C447/C449 workarounds.

## Definition of Done

The exact targeted saved effects/refusals and focused cases pass with code/test hashes. Required parent integration and image proof remain separate.

### Current completed result

lifecycle_intents.py `b9ebeb03e5f567667519b24f7d87ad1bac479d5acae69559b0f5f6093a92051c`; native tests `0bb33ae0f2ff78b51b9052d2e55f13600570cc6baaf619398aebd79386d4feec`; atom_operations.py preserved at `77d85a83d5fa4367c23d18b5f354c00b8c5514f84c04c2641ddb0793e5a72009`. Eight native Draft-promotion and fourteen model-driven status tests passed in the designated development worker. Head-first pending lookup preserves the planned identity on partial/final retries, including after old-Draft removal; changed requests refuse before archive-reference diagnostics. Independent P1638 still rejects the separate Draft Update head-validation gap; P1699 owns that repair. This leaf completion does not accept the full native integration or image/MCP proof.
