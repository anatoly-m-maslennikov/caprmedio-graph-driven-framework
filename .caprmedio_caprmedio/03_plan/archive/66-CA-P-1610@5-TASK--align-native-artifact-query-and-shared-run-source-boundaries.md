# Summary

Align native Artifact query and shared Run source boundaries

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, repair the four inherited source statements that incorrectly assign shared Run/Journal integration to the pure native Artifact query entrypoint. Own R1849, M330, D551, O158 and exact predecessor archives only. Preserve pure read-only queries and actual admitted shared recording.

## Details

### Result

The author saved CA-R-1849@3, CA-M-330@3, CA-D-551@4 and CA-O-158@3. The pure Tool owns no Run/Journal integration; the admitted selected Action/Workflow uses CA-D-527–529. D551 retains no route-local Run/Journal storage. O158 explicitly rebinds R1849@3, R1850@2, M330@3, E569@2 and D551@4. Summaries and IDs are unchanged; exact predecessor archives retain R1849@2, M330@2, D551@3 and O158@2. Parsing/identity/version checks and diff checks passed.

Current hashes: R1849 f70123260870f72cefe7163f784826eca4131cf250915726e9bbdacee6e91759; M330 e68b0fb6cbee59c3d2e662648c8f33bb6bec3dbae58b40345b24d0620b813590; D551 292dd73b41e95b48d210d510275a456dddd5322b9b97cd666f52ff06bb8e4e78; O158 abe5ae697b49f9bd67c10261456fff398a97e0a6900d814aa4a06777b3f21e0f.

P1532 remains an immutable prior acceptance, not an attestation of these new bytes. No Tool code, current selected-route manifest, runtime or image was changed by this Task. Fresh independent P1611 acceptance must precede rebind through P1527.

## Definition of Done

The bounded four-carrier source correction and exact archives are saved and handed to independent source acceptance; authoring completion is not source acceptance or execution.
