# Summary

Repair the graph and background fixture premises

## Objective

repair graph disposable Git fixture and exact background-services private-reader fixture without relaxing the accepted release or source-currentness boundaries.

## Details

- this bounded lane feeds a fresh source-bound N10; retain failed N9 without replay.
- root owns Git, integration, source pins, canonical refresh and actual dispatch. workers preserve other lanes' changes.
- local fixture/source acceptance is not full Release acceptance; installed N remains unchanged.

## Definition of Done

d1be603f6; fourteen graph and three background cases pass; production guards unchanged.
