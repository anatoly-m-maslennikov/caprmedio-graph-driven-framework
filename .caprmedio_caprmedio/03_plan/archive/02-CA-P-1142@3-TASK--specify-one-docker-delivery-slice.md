# Summary

Specify one Docker delivery slice

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for specify one docker delivery slice, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Bind one image/runtime capability family to exact current RMED owners. Add/update R outcomes, M build/construction techniques, E image-execution acceptance, and D image artifacts/entrypoints/runtime interfaces before code changes. Reuse the current runtime image where it satisfies the contract; split images only for demonstrated incompatible requirements.

### Required output

Reviewed RMED for one image family, pinned/reproducible dependency inputs under current policy, runtime credentials supplied externally rather than baked in, explicit project authority/delivery/runtime mounts and mutation/Git/Journal permissions. Add review and further specification leaves as needed.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
