# Summary

Complete Artifact query namespace collision golden case

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, complete this bounded repair or acceptance packet with saved source-bound evidence.

## Details

Inputs: accepted CA-P-1532 exact Artifact source pins, CA-E-569 and CA-P-1544 test-coverage rejection. Ownership: only FIND_AND_FETCH_ARTIFACTS/tests/test_find_and_fetch_artifacts.py. Add a same-spelling frontmatter key and Markdown section heading fixture; prove their fm: and canonical section: selectors resolve independently in filters and selected fetch, including default IDs and no accidental collision. Do not change the implementation/parser or invent new carrier grammar. Run the entire Artifact suite and shared filter suite in the current development Docker worker. No source/Plan/Journal/MCP/manifest edits.

Inherit CA-P-1117's 90% confidence threshold and explicit mechanical Git save exception. You are not alone; preserve other workers' edits and use apply_patch. No harvesting, FPF, broad audit, permission bypass, deployment or unrelated changes. Root owns Plan updates and commits. If unfinished, return exact remainder; do not mark the aggregate Epic Done.

### Definition of Done

The owned packet has actual scoped evidence and a truthful saved result. The final fifteen-Workflow Docker/MCP proof remains separate.

### Actual result

The sole changed file is FIND_AND_FETCH_ARTIFACTS/tests/test_find_and_fetch_artifacts.py. Identically spelled fm:/summary and section:/2:summary values are tested independently through default IDs, filter selection and selected fetch. A second Artifact carries the frontmatter value but no matching section, proving there is no namespace overlap. The worker's full Artifact/shared-parser run passed sixteen tests before CA-P-1548's additional statistics tests landed; final combined current-code acceptance remains CA-P-1547.
