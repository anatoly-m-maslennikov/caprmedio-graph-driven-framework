# Summary

Require preparation Evaluation authority

## Objective

require the bound Evaluation at preparation and test missing, stale and wrong-role bindings before any agent call.

## Details

- keep this repair bounded to its confirmed source contract. shared installed runtime, frozen candidates and historical Journals remain unchanged by fixture tests.
- preserve independent workers' edits; root owns Git, source pins and Release integration.

## Definition of Done

the preparation rejection matrix and focused prompt/binding suites pass; rejected cases call no agent.

## Result

the preparation test rejects missing, stale and wrong-role Evaluation bindings before dispatch. the focused prompt-contract suite passes 20 tests and selected-project-binding suite passes seven; independent review accepts the repair. actual full Release completion remains a separate unfinished gate.
