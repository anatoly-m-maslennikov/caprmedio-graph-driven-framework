# Summary

Review current Subject packet review-r-017

## Objective

Freshly review every Subject occurrence in this exact whole-source packet.

## Details

Estimated own work: 15 minutes for one AI Agent, using the shared CA-P-2193 review contract. Own 20 whole Requirement source Atoms and 63 occurrences from [the packet](../../../../../.caprmedio_tmp/stage2-migration-20261012/inventory/batches/review-r-017.json), SHA-256 `87fc4945e16cc7c8bf85cae9c53c0c2f7eb06ed1cdfdd3294ca5614008bdc7de`. Read every complete current owner and review its governs/dependencies together; all source Version/hash/occurrence pins are in that packet. Split a concrete overrun before execution; no partial packet becomes Done.

Required capture input: CA-P-2187 Done and [the current inventory](../../../../../.caprmedio_tmp/stage2-migration-20261012/inventory/current-subjects.inventory.json), SHA-256 `0b2f217e8ebf541cc84322d18be81073bfdbb54342f248cbf9928583678455c7`. Bind [Candidate #3](../../../../_projection/core-entity-review/presentation/operator.model.candidate-3.md), SHA-256 `ff34c4d75d64766543f397024b0d003e9f8c6e2293e97a8a51e56b8f737be7a2`, and [the latest Operator decision record](../../../../../.caprmedio_tmp/stage2-migration-20261012/model/operator-subject-decisions.md), SHA-256 `ce28c370232ae43829036714eb24957987d11453fd94a76c4794997b088ecfb5`. Historical byte equality, old Task completion and earlier reports do not supply fresh semantic acceptance.

Apply the parent review contract: preserve exact source predicates/qualifiers and role-specific meaning; distinguish Object, Term and Selection. Named Selections are permitted, never Objects by that permission; owning-Atom and target-Atom subsets remain distinct. Preserve Owning Scope Unit, relational Target Scope Unit and exact governed Substance Scope; the legacy combined lookup Selection is not a fourth scope. Record supported change, supported unchanged or unresolved for every occurrence with current source evidence, prospective exact value and confidence. Below 90%, investigate then ask through Root before adoption/staging; do not infer new selector grammar or endpoint admission.

Own only this packet's derived review output under `.caprmedio_tmp/stage2-migration-20261012/reviews/`; preserve prior reports and other workers' outputs. Freeze the actual report path/hash and full-owner coverage for a separate independent reviewer. That reviewer must check current source/candidate/decision pins, semantic evidence and every prospective value, not only syntax/counts. No source/Tool/content edits, migration staging, accepted final graph, integration or publication is included.

### Definition of Done

Not Done if any owner/occurrence or independent semantic receipt is missing, a pin is stale, a qualifier/meaning is unsupported, uncertainty is adopted, a prior report is treated as fresh acceptance, source/history/Journal/content bytes change or own work exceeds 15 minutes without decomposition.
