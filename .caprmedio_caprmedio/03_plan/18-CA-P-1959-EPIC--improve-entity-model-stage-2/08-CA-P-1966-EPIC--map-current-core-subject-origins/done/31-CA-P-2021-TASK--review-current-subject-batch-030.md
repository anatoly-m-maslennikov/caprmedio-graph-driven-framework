# Summary

Review current Subject batch 030

## Objective

Account for every assigned current Subject occurrence with live meaning evidence and no guessed replacement.

## Details

Estimated own work: 15 minutes. Required prerequisites: CA-P-1972, CA-P-1988, CA-P-1989, CA-P-1990 Done. Read and pin `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/current-subjects.contract.md` SHA-256 `5eb0d90022b68a7d1d2cd27cf60a147deaf4161cb9b2e1c8bdf6c4ef8f2a10bf` and `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/current-subjects.review.contract.md` SHA-256 `b7c9c065f997d5bae1409f5c09b4223d08327a523decab6d26c2e4425fd2c28b`. Input: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/inputs/current-subjects.batch-030.json`, SHA-256 `ef54b303cf496bea0cead9a8f693c6f95a240b56859a6fb0104b0d17a2d89d20`; inventory SHA-256 `e284dbe4943568bc75b7f9ba63ebf583372a60813e62eee3d43b5b75b270220a`. This batch owns 17 sources and 115 occurrences exclusively.

Recheck each source pin, then read its current Main Content. Compare the frozen candidate/review as separate evidence; do not refresh captured files or infer meaning from a label alone. Return one row per occurrence under the review-output contract: unchanged, proposed or unresolved; exact old value, nullable proposed value, confidence, current evidence spans/hashes, preserved distinctions and any concrete question. Below 90%, leave the replacement null. Report quarantined sources and unresolved findings. No deletion, source write, grammar adoption, native admission or schema/key rename.

Own only `stage2/reviews/current-subjects.batch-030.review.json` and an optional same-batch support helper. Root owns integration and Git. Preserve others' edits. If work exceeds 15 minutes, create bounded decomposition before continuing. Creating this Plan does not start or complete review.

Completion: independent structural checks passed for 17 current sources and 115 exact occurrences. Independent meaning review checked all proposed and high-risk unchanged rows in batches 028–031. Two occurrences lacking proof of the whole Subjects field were corrected to unresolved. This is not a blanket rejection of the separately defined Atom Subjects Property. The 71 unresolved rows remain explicit research in the report and required ledger integration. All rows remain non-executable; no original Atom changed. Evidence: stage2/task-2021.receipt.json. Review completion is not mapping completion or migration approval.

### Definition of Done

Not Done if a pin is stale, coverage overlaps or omits an assigned occurrence/source finding, a proposal lacks current meaning evidence, uncertainty is hidden, Core or captured files change, or own work exceeds 15 minutes without decomposition. A completed proposal is not migration approval.
