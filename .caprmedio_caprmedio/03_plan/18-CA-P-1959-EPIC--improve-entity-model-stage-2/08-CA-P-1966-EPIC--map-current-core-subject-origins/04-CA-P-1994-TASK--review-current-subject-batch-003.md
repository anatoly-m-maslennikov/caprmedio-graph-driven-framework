# Summary

Review current Subject batch 003

## Objective

Account for every assigned current Subject occurrence with live meaning evidence and no guessed replacement.

## Details

Estimated own work: 15 minutes. Required prerequisites: CA-P-1972, CA-P-1988, CA-P-1989, CA-P-1990 Done. Read and pin `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/current-subjects.contract.md` SHA-256 `5eb0d90022b68a7d1d2cd27cf60a147deaf4161cb9b2e1c8bdf6c4ef8f2a10bf` and `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/current-subjects.review.contract.md` SHA-256 `b7c9c065f997d5bae1409f5c09b4223d08327a523decab6d26c2e4425fd2c28b`. Input: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/core-entity-review/stage2/inputs/current-subjects.batch-003.json`, SHA-256 `04b9a9160f4f5b7a21c18013ff32b858df8488c88513f17d5aaa49897245e8ca`; inventory SHA-256 `e284dbe4943568bc75b7f9ba63ebf583372a60813e62eee3d43b5b75b270220a`. This batch owns 20 sources and 79 occurrences exclusively.

Recheck each source pin, then read its current Main Content. Compare the frozen candidate/review as separate evidence; do not refresh captured files or infer meaning from a label alone. Return one row per occurrence under the review-output contract: unchanged, proposed or unresolved; exact old value, nullable proposed value, confidence, current evidence spans/hashes, preserved distinctions and any concrete question. Below 90%, leave the replacement null. Report quarantined sources and unresolved findings. No deletion, source write, grammar adoption, native admission or schema/key rename.

Own only `stage2/reviews/current-subjects.batch-003.review.json` and an optional same-batch support helper. Root owns integration and Git. Preserve others' edits. If work exceeds 15 minutes, create bounded decomposition before continuing. Creating this Plan does not start or complete review.

### Definition of Done

Not Done if a pin is stale, coverage overlaps or omits an assigned occurrence/source finding, a proposal lacks current meaning evidence, uncertainty is hidden, Core or captured files change, or own work exceeds 15 minutes without decomposition. A completed proposal is not migration approval.
