# Summary

Execute the gated local release cycle

## Objective

Execute Local release with commit-all before every step and at completion.

## Details

- Follow CA-P-1848's current direct happy path. Earlier snapshot, admission, selector, recovery and complete-corpus gate requirements are superseded.
- Commit everything before every release step and at the end, respecting Git ignore rules and secret exclusions.
- Stop and report a failed step for manual handling; no automatic rollback or retry.
- Preserve configuration, Project records and other Projects. Ignore .DS_Store.

- Completion evidence: Host MCP Run epic1848-direct-local-20261012-001 completed. Git checkpoints surround the direct steps; the terminal Journal event and this closure are included in the final integration commit.
- Live Local receipt: .caprmedio_runtime/simple_local_release/reports/epic1848-direct-local-20261012-001.md. Consolidated verification: .caprmedio_tmp/epic1848/direct-local-completion.md.

## Definition of Done

The Objective is implemented and verified with actual evidence appropriate to this task. Record remaining manual issues. Mock tests do not prove live release, installation, MCP or PR completion.
