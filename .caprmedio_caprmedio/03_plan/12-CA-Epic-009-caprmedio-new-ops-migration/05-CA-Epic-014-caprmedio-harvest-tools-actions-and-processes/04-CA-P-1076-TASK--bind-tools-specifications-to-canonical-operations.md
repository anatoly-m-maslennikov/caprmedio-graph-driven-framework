# Bind TOOLS specifications to canonical Operations

the Assignee **must** replace duplicated Tool procedure authority with precise canonical Operation references.

## Scope

(selected RMEDO authority **in** the TOOLS subtree at `.caprmedio_caprmedio/102_LAYER_2_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_FEATURE_PROGRAMMATIC/301_FEATURE_TOOLS`); the source **and** lifecycle admission boundary established by CA-P-976 applies; historical versions, generated copies, runtime, Implementation code, **and** other CAP Atoms are excluded.

## Definition of Done

the Task is **not** Done **if** ((TOOLS RMED still independently defines a harvested canonical procedure) **or** (a binding lacks the supported Action **or** Process identity) **or** (removing a procedural clause loses an Implementation requirement, Method choice, Evaluation, **or** Delivery boundary) **or** (a Tool implementation **or** installed package is modified)).

## Details

apply **only** source-level bindings **and** lossless Claim repairs. preserve remaining Tool capability Spec **and** admit partial-process support explicitly. use the graph-owned relation kinds established earlier; do **not** invent scope-**to**-scope dependency edges. actual executable Tool adoption is outside RMEDO scope **and** **must not** be claimed here.

execute **only** **after** the explicit prerequisite is Done. **if** confidence **in** a decision is below the effective Autonomous Confidence Threshold, check Project Principles first **and** ask the Operator **if** uncertainty remains; do **not** silently select a new design. no migration is executed merely by creating this Task.
