# Summary

Implement the opt-in HTTP gateway

## Objective

Implement the opt-in HTTP gateway under the parent's exact source contract.

## Details

http_mcp_restore exclusively owns 204_MCP/http_server.py, server.py, hot_reload.py and WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR/docker/entrypoint.py, runtime.py, mcp-http.compose.yaml.

Estimated execution slice <=15 minutes. Preserve other workers' changes. Root alone owns index, commits and actual shared runtime effects. Tests and disposable smoke evidence are not release promotion.

## Definition of Done

The optional adapter and lifecycle honor R1884/1885 M341/342 D578; unchanged stdio regression passes.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this exclusive bounded assignment as the minimal current parent repair. Preserve installed N and truthful observed effects.

## Recorded verification

e63cb5457; the accepted optional adapter and lifecycle preserve stdio default and explicit HTTP configuration. Root's full 18-case transport/runtime suite passed.
