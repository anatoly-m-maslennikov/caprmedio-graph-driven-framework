# Summary

Deliver the guarded Release binding refresh

## Objective

deliver and use the Operator-approved, source-first guarded refresh of the existing sixteen-route Release binding, without weakening ordinary admission or changing installed runtime N.

## Details

- root owns the RMED amendments, integration, exact Operator authorization and actual journaled publication. independently bounded worker lanes own refresh-base validation, trusted publication/recovery, regression proof and read-only review; each implementation or verification slice has an estimated duration <=15 minutes.
- R1882/M339/E582/D576 v3 govern the narrow same-route, same-identity pin refresh. preserve the initial fifteen-to-sixteen operation and historical sealed-intent normalization.
- normal discovery/dispatch/loading remain strict. the new private refresh validator is non-dispatching; it cannot admit route, query, registry, source-identity or occurrence changes.
- actual refresh follows an exact byte-preserving plan and trusted operation-specific Operator context, sealed pending intent, canonical carrier lock, atomic replacement, strict readback and canonical Journal finalization. if recording is uncertain, inspect the saved result before recovery; never replay the write.
- only after accepted refresh, resume the remaining Epic gates using a fresh source-bound Release Run through MCP. N5–N8 remain immutable historical evidence.

## Definition of Done

### Observed frontier

source v3 and code/regression proofs are independently accepted at 6b9ae7a5c/d24eb8d89. the first attempt stopped before writing because of a pre-existing Journal history gap. after CA-P-1781's approved recovered state v3, the actual guarded refresh completed at 2026-10-06T15:21:02+04:00 and was recorded once as `release-manifest:57af554ee877ac760ed9ec157b191cfd4dda085927de0a35b8fb20fd659b11e8`, carrier revision 4, linked to that state. strict loading admits all sixteen routes with canonical digest `19757c9cb6e5977f5193e5b2fcf5fccee0efabb923a7fee7f99bac43d820bc98` and raw digest `8a34d012baf806e536b754d42396f260cf97e0bdd93854780ef87ff4acf18403`. historical Journal prefixes and installed N's selector are unchanged; no publication is pending. no N9 dispatch or promotion is claimed by this Task.

the amended source contract and implementation have independent acceptance; focused initial and refresh regression suites pass; the actual canonical binding is refreshed and strictly reopened; its Journal record is verified with no pending publication; installed N remains unchanged. this Task does not claim the complete Release gate or Epic closure.

## Pre-execution review

the Operator explicitly approved this guarded capability and its use after RMED. C496 identifies the confirmed missing refresh path; resetting or hand-editing the canonical binding is not an alternative. use the existing source-owned D572 derivation and lifecycle support rather than another registry or Journal.
