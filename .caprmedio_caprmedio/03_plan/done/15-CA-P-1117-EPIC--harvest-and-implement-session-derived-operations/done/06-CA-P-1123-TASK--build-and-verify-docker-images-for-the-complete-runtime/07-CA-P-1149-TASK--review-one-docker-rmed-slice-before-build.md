# Summary

Review one Docker RMED slice before build

## Objective

The assigned independent AI Agent subagent must review one bounded Docker RMED slice against current Project and methodology authority before its image implementation or build begins.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Bind at most eight directly relevant source Atoms from CA-P-1142, exact capability/image inventory rows, current authority revisions, delivery contracts and proposed runtime mounts. The reviewer is read-only and is not the author. Check complete workflow/MCP/tool coverage, role and tier ownership, declared dependencies, image versus host implementation separation, credentials, mutation/Git/Journal permission compatibility and functional acceptance.

### Required output

Evidence-backed review findings with typed C atoms and dispositions, a reviewed build packet, and an updated CA-P-1143 before execution. Create separate <=15-minute repair and re-review tasks for findings and more review leaves for remaining image families; wire them as explicit blockers of affected builds.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Bind exact inputs/output/verification before execution; split larger packets first. Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold. Below threshold check the active Goal and Project Principles, then record the best safe in-scope choice in a C/Question if still uncertain. Any blocker/failure becomes a C/Problem; incompatible authority becomes a C/Conflict. Postpone blocked work and select an independent ready task.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound RMED packet lacks independent review; any finding lacks a typed Concern and disposition; necessary repair/re-review or remaining review packets lack explicit task files and BLOCKS edges; or the next dependent build Plan was not reviewed and updated from the results. A blocked or timed-out review is not Done.
