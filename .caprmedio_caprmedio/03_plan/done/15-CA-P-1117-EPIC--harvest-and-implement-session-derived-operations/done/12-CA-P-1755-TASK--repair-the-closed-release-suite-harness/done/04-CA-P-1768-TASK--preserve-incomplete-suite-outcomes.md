# Summary

Preserve incomplete suite outcomes

## Objective

Preserve incomplete suite outcomes under the parent's exact source contract.

## Details

n5_unit_diagnosis exclusively owns RELEASE_VERSION/release_suite.py and tests/test_release_suite.py.

Estimated execution slice <=15 minutes. Preserve other workers' changes. Root alone owns index, commits and actual shared runtime effects. Tests and disposable smoke evidence are not release promotion.

## Definition of Done

No-executor remains incomplete with no host execution; actual post-effect stale and recording failure remain nonpassing; current workspace-fixture contracts are verified.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this exclusive bounded assignment as the minimal current parent repair. Preserve installed N and truthful observed effects.

## Recorded verification

6e4b3acc2; root's complete test_release_suite command passed 26 cases, preserving incomplete/no-host-execution, immutable workspace and recording-failure nonpass.
