# Summary

cover real approved reversal cancellation

## Objective

Correct only the exact independent RMED findings before implementation. Estimate <=15 minutes; inherited threshold 90%. No harvesting, FPF, code or broader audit. Root retains review findings in C430 and review Plans; actual independent re-acceptance is required.

### Inputs and ownership

Current P1496 review, current exact native carriers E553/E554, their accepted source Operations and shared D527/528/529. Re-read relevant active Goal/Principles. Preserve other workers' edits; use apply_patch. Archive prior meaningful revisions under their native archive path, bump semantic Version and use actual Updated At.

### Required correction

Resolve P1496's only blocker with bounded QA detail. Add actual MCP/Tool cancellation at a safe boundary: admitted cancellation, exact completed/unattempted/uncertain effect accounting, canceled non-success result; standalone O131 Action Run has no invented parent, uses durable admitted Abandoned terminal Journal event. Cover WF+Action execution and no auto rollback or effect replay; partial continuation only unattempted effects with fresh exact approval/currentness if existing authority admits it. Preserve existing happy/noop/blocked/failed/partial/recordretry cases. Only E553/E554 current carriers/history and this Plan; no code.

### Verification and result

Reopen every changed saved carrier; verify exact properties/sections, corrected semantics and source pins. Return exact files/versions and one compact fix-to-finding mapping. Save that actual result here, mark/move this leaf Done only if all bound corrections are saved. No runtime proof or independent review is claimed. If <=15-minute scope cannot finish, retain an exact remainder/frontier rather than mark partial Done.

## Details

### Definition of Done

All named correction obligations are saved and locally verified, and ready for independent focused re-acceptance. Runtime/code remains gated.

## Actual result

Done at 2026-10-04 23:00:41 +0400. Saved only CA-E-553 v2 and CA-E-554 v2, retaining their complete v1 carriers under their native `06_evaluation/archive/` paths with Archived lifecycle metadata. CA-E-553 v2 adds real-MCP safe-boundary admission coverage: admitted cancellation is `canceled` (not `reverted`/`no_op`), carries its manifest/account, exercises Workflow-plus-Action lineage, and forbids rollback/inverse/replay. CA-E-554 v2 adds exact execution coverage: `completed`/`unattempted`/`uncertain` accounting; separate Workflow-plus-Action and standalone O131 Action Runs; no fabricated parent; one durable admitted `Abandoned` Journal terminal event; and continuation limited to unattempted effects after fresh exact approval/currentness admission. Existing happy, no-op, blocked, failed, partial, Journal-failure, and recording-retry cases are retained. This is a saved QA-spec correction only, not runtime proof or independent re-acceptance.
