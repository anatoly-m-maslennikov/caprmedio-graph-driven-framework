# Summary

Author one PROGRAMMATIC RMED slice

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for author one programmatic rmed slice, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Bind one adopted capability to exact PROGRAMMATIC/TOOLS/APPS/MCP owning carriers. R specifies implementation outcomes; M explains construction techniques for implementation or tests; E owns assurance policy, acceptance conditions and test cases; D specifies delivery/carriers. Respect active local tiers and Project-local -> methodology sources -> engine sequence.

### Required output

A rebuild-sufficient current RMED packet for the capability, source-operation linkage, executable functional contract, and exact file ownership for implementation. Add bounded leaves for the remaining capabilities.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Saved authoring completion

P1484–P1489/P1491 supplied the seven native PROGRAMMATIC RMED families; P1492 supplied the bounded thirteen-route Docker portfolio. All nine relevant authoring/acceptance leaves are saved Done. The exact corrected packets are now inputs to P1493–P1499 independent reviews; no code/runtime completion is claimed. C430 retains the bounded authoring corrections until review acceptance.

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
