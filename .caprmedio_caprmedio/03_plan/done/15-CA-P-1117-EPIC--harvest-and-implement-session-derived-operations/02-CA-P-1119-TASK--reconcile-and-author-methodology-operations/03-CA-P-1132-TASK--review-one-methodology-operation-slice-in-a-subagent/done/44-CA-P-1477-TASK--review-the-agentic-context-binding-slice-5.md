# Summary

Review the Agentic context binding slice 5

## Objective

After P1470 is physically Done, independently review only current v2 Steps CA-O-156, CA-O-157 against R1527v4/C426 and their v1 histories. Focus on the new binding: explicit supplied runtime context, exactly one Integrated/Isolated choice before Agentic dispatch, no fallback, missing/unsupported/unavailable blocks, Programmatic behavior unaffected. Verify every other clause/input/Action reference/Summary remains unchanged. Historical metadata may differ only by admitted archive Status/Updated At.

Own only this Plan. Do not repeat prior full source reviews or repair any source through review. You are not alone. Estimate <=6 minutes; exact scenario comparison and one saved check. No code, FPF, harvest, Git or Journal writes.

## Details

### Independent review result

PASS, no issues found in this bounded context-binding slice. P1470 was physically Done before review. The independent reviewer read the complete O156/O157 Active v2 carriers, both complete Archived v1 carriers, R1527v4, C426v1 and this leaf's P1132 ownership controls. Only this Plan was changed; no source repair, runtime execution or root-owned C426/source-stage acceptance is implied.

One saved focused diff/case gate ran at 2026-10-04 17:57:42 UTC, exit 0. For each exact pair, it checked Active v2, Archived v1 and exactly one new `### Agentic invocation binding` subsection; `diff -u` then found no differences after removing that added subsection and the `status`, `version` and `updated_at` fields. This proves unchanged Summary, every other body clause, original inputs, Action IDs O008/O009, subject/relation metadata and complete archived bodies within this comparison. Version changes 1 to 2 and admitted archive Status/Updated At are accounted for; no original-byte lifecycle-field claim is made.

The same gate's independent clause walkthrough covers both changed paragraphs:

| Actual invocation case | Required source outcome | Review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agentic, one supplied Integrated, required context/capability available | Bind exactly that one context before dispatch; retain it with the Step Run | PASS |
| Agentic, one supplied Isolated, required context/capability available | Bind exactly that one context before dispatch; retain it with the Step Run | PASS |
| Agentic, missing runtime parameter | Block that invocation; no default or substitution | PASS |
| Agentic, ambiguous runtime values | Block that invocation; no default or substitution | PASS |
| Agentic, unsupported runtime value | Block that invocation; no default or substitution | PASS |
| Agentic, selected context or required capability unavailable | Block that invocation; no default or substitution | PASS |
| Programmatic, with or without this parameter | No Agent context or parameter requirement; original behavior remains | PASS |

The conditional binding tests the actual bound Action's execution kind, preserves Action identity/behavior and grants no authority. O156 retains separately authorized source correction, return to selection and reassessment after source changes, and the guard against publishing from an earlier assessment after failure/partial effects. O157 retains exact source identity/bytes/form, valid approval and resolved-conflict guards, unchanged membership on failure and ordered deterministic membership. These are source-definition cases, not executed Run evidence. No typed Concern is required because this review found no issue; P1132/P1158/P1160 and root-owned runtime gates remain for their owners.

### Definition of Done

Focused independent result and source revisions are saved, with truthful findings/disposition. Physical Done placement denotes only completed review; root owns C426/source-stage acceptance.
