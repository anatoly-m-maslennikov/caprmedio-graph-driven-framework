# Summary

Reconcile the Source Reconciliation candidate

## Objective

One assigned AI Agent must reconcile exactly one completed-evidence Source Reconciliation candidate family with current source authority and save its reuse / gap / destination decision in CA-A-1058. Estimate <=15 minutes, including the bounded comparison and completion verification. CA-P-1155 bound this Plan; execution began at 2026-10-04 12:34:57 UTC. Independent acceptance passed before this Plan became Done; the actual overrun is retained below.

### Exact inputs and governing revisions

- Closed-corpus controls: CA-P-1117 v2, CA-P-1119 v2 and CA-P-1130 v3. Admit the 102 completed packets / 5,463 records only; CA-A-1043 is partial and excluded. The Operator stopped harvesting; canceled harvest descendants are not prerequisites.
- Completed saved evidence: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-924-ANALYSIS_RPRT--harvest-the-later-second-partition-session-packet.md`, candidate C02 and historical decisions D03–D04, with their cited S031 / S033 / S035 / S038 / S039 / S044 / S045 / S047 / S048 antecedents as retained in this Analysis. Read saved evidence only, never native sessions. Historical assistant proposals and reported changes do not prove current adoption or implementation.
- Current generic Workflow CA-O-010 v7: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/CA-O-010-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--reconcile-sources.md`; preflight SHA-256 `fe23f033b0c68300ba3e63cdab27e574a81b4e4781c79a0ea06d1f659da55e94`.
- Current Applicable Methodology binding Workflow CA-O-011 v10: `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework/00_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources/001_CORE_META_MODEL/09_operations/CA-O-011-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--bind-source-reconciliation-to-applicable-methodology.md`; preflight SHA-256 `7afcae57fc1496c5f01e74ec39735b76b7df9c0189f72cd4db509a4ba787cf83`.
- Live Goal v13 and all 14 active Project Principles govern. Reuse previously full reads only after unchanged fingerprint verification; read changed authority fully. Use current CA-R-1589 v4, CA-R-1580 v4, CA-D-460 v6, CA-D-470 v7, CA-D-481 v4, CA-D-461 v6 and CA-D-479 v6. Source Operations, not generated Applicable Methodology projections, are authority. Inherit CA-P-1117's 90% confidence threshold and latest-Operator-input rule.

### Ownership and required output

Own this Plan and `.caprmedio_caprmedio/02_analysis/CA-A-1058-ANALYSIS_RPRT--reconcile-the-source-reconciliation-candidate.md` only; CA-A-1058 is reserved and must not be created by the preflight. Reserve CA-C-350 for a confirmed current source-carrier issue. Other agents own the other candidate families; preserve their changes. No O, RMED, runtime, code, settings, shared parent, Journal or Git writes; no native harvesting or new discovery Epic.

Save a proposition-to-current-clause table covering selection, conflict detection, proposed / actual approval of upstream fixes, correction and re-evaluation, content-preserving publication, derivation versus Carrier materialization, and reusable flow versus specific binding. For each proposition record the exact evidence, current Operation clause / revision and adopted-gap, already-covered, rejected or deferred disposition. Distinguish a reusable Applicable Methodology binding from a caprmedio-specific migration: the older Analysis destination suggestion cannot override current owning authority. Decide exact CORE_META_MODEL or PROJECT_CONFIGURATION destination with rationale and RMED ownership; do not presume that both require new Operations.

Prefer equivalent existing O010 / O011 rather than duplicate Workflows. Check the two source Carrier layouts against current CA-D-479; if an actual layout gap is confirmed, link typed CA-C-350 and identify the exact later-authoring targets and preservation conditions, but do not repair them here. Record independent review, RMED and implementation follow-up separately from the reconciliation decision. Any substantive remainder or unresolved authority choice must have explicit disposition / Concern and retained blocking readiness, not a broad completion claim.

### Independent functional verification and next gate

An independent checker who did not produce CA-A-1058 must reopen its saved table, the bound A924 sections and both full current source Workflows. Acceptance scenario: trace every bound proposition to exact live clauses; verify that already-covered behavior is not duplicated, source authority determines each destination, historical reports are not treated as runtime proof, and any confirmed Carrier gap has a typed Concern and exact unperformed follow-up. Falsify acceptance if any proposition is omitted, a destination rests only on the historical suggestion, or an Operation edit / execution is claimed without current evidence. Record checker identity, live revisions and pass / fail in A1058 before this Plan can become Done. The producer cannot self-approve this gate; if unavailable within the estimate, retain the unfinished gate truthfully.

Check saved YAML, the Analysis headings `# Summary`, `## Question`, `## Scope`, `## Approach`, `## Results`, `## TLDR`, unique IDs and the local BLOCKS DAG. Reopen the saved result before closure. CA-P-1155 BLOCKS this Plan; this Plan BLOCKS CA-P-1131 and CA-P-1156. The parent, other reconciliation family children and CA-P-1345 consolidation gates remain in force. On completion report the exact decision / verification to root, which owns parent integration and any next authoring binding; move only this Plan Markdown under `done/` by CA-D-461 when actually Done.

### Saved result and independent acceptance

CA-A-1058 saves the exact evidence-to-current-clause table and reuse decision for O010 v7 / O011 v10. Both reusable Workflows belong to CORE_META_MODEL; the historical generic-binding PROJECT_CONFIGURATION suggestion cannot override them. CA-C-350 records the confirmed CA-D-479 v6 heading-layout gap in both exact source Carriers and a later meaning-preserving repair, not an Operation edit performed here. Producer structural observation passed 2026-10-04 12:49:26 UTC: nine unique registered strict-YAML Carriers, seven-node local Plan DAG, physical prerequisite placement, saved reopen and unchanged exact source hashes. Independent checker /root passed at 2026-10-04 12:50 UTC after reopening the full table, bound saved A924 evidence, both full current source Workflows and C350; all 11 propositions/destinations and preserved gates passed, with no runtime or authoring claim. The exact receipt is saved in A1058 before this physical Done placement. All parent/consolidation/authoring gates remain in force.

First execution clock 2026-10-04 12:34:57 UTC was never reset after recorded preparation/lookup failures and their bounded recovery. Physical Done persistence observed 2026-10-04 12:51:30 UTC: 993 seconds elapsed, 93 seconds beyond the 900-second estimate, including independent-review wait and receipt persistence. C350 remains Active; only bounded reconciliation is complete. Root owns parent integration and next authoring binding; no next work is executed here.

## Details

### Definition of Done

CA-A-1058 exists with every bound proposition dispositioned against current authority, exact source revisions and destination rationale, any confirmed issue linked to typed CA-C-350, and a passed independent checker receipt. Required remainders and downstream gates remain explicit. This Plan is not Done if the output or independent verification is missing, authority changed without rereading, native harvesting resumed, sources were authored outside scope, or this one-family result is presented as whole-stage reconciliation or implementation.
