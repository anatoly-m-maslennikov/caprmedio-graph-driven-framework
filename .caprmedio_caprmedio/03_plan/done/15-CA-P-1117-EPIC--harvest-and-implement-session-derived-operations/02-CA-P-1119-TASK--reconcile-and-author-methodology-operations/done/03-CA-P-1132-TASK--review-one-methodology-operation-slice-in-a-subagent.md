# Summary

Review one methodology operation slice in a subagent

## Objective

The assigned AI Agent must complete one bounded work packet for review one methodology operation slice in a subagent, using the stated inputs and ownership restrictions, and record the required output without extending this leaf's scope.

### Inputs and bounded ownership

Assign one read-only subagent the exact operation slice, source revisions, Project Principles, and applicable methodology authority. Review the destination rationale as well as the Operation: reusable, project-independent Operations belong to CORE_META_MODEL; caprmedio-specific Operations belong to PROJECT_CONFIGURATION. Reviewer must not be the author of that slice. Limit one leaf to at most four changed Operations; do not grant repair authority through review.

Bind only source Operations actually required by CA-P-1117 v3's thirteen selected Workflows, including all Workflow/Action Run journaling and the Entities Graph, Terms Graph and Applicable Methodology builders. CA-P-1157 first maps existing definitions and actual gaps, then creates bounded authoring/review leaves as needed. The former five additional assessment Actions and all thirty-nine prior changed Operations are not automatically a new review campaign.

The Operator excluded CA-P-1131's legacy closure from required decomposition. Its former incoming gates are removed; this does not remove the independent review of sources actually used by the selected Workflows or authorize a bypass of CA-C-410's filesystem denial. Bind actual source files, not their old parent-folder closure.

### Required output

An evidence-backed finding/disposition record with typed C atoms for every issue and a revised dependent specification packet. Repairs and remaining review packets receive separate <=15-minute leaf files; parent completion requires all slices reviewed.

### Composite packet and execution gate

This packet Plan is composite. Its initial preflight child has an estimate of <=15 minutes; actual execution children are created only after their inputs, ownership, output and verification are bound. Composite roll-up effort depends on the resulting decomposition. Before execution, the parent/preceding-task review must bind the exact evidence packet or capability IDs, live governing revisions, target file paths, output and verification command/scenario in this file. If they cannot be bound safely or exceed the estimate, create narrower subtasks before execution rather than starting an underspecified leaf. A remainder is represented by new Plan files and explicit dependency edges, not an untracked promise.

Inherit CA-P-1117 controls and the 90% confidence threshold through IS_DECOMPOSITION_OF. Every issue requires a typed C atom: blocker/failure -> Problem; unresolved choice -> Question; incompatible authority -> Conflict. Postpone a blocked task and work on another independent ready task. After completion, reassess and update affected dependent tasks before they start. Retain durable source/result/provenance evidence; do not mark the parent Done merely because this first packet is Done.

## Details

### Source-stage acceptance

Accepted the full selected source frontier: thirteen requests reuse seven Workflow definitions plus shared reconciliation, identified Steps/Actions and every-Run journaling. A1142 records exact sources/reviews. Root resolved C415–C420/C423–C429 using their actual focused verdicts; recovered preparation evidence is retained in C421/C422. P1483 independently accepted the final four-source correction. The 126-carrier source-stage scan found no unfinished required leaf; only this parent and explicitly excluded P1131 remained Active. All required children are Done. No runtime pass is claimed.

### Current selected source packets

A1141 and Done P1435 bind the actual thirteen-request frontier. Execute these independent bounded packets, not another discovery or harvest campaign:

- P1437: reuse review of O015/O012–014 for all four structural requests.
- P1438: reusable lifecycle graph and current identity/status guards.
- P1439: approved Revert Changes graph.
- P1440: independent O016 carrier/graph review and exact current Step/Action bindings.
- P1441: Entities Graph and Terms Graph builder bindings.
- P1442: Applicable Methodology source reuse review and compiler differences.
- P1443: shared every-Workflow/Action-Run Journal source contract.
- P1444: four lifecycle Tool source/Carrier/RMED dispositions.

Each packet explicitly blocks this source-stage acceptance and the dependent specification preflights. Authoring outputs require a separate independent reviewer; read-only source reuse reviews may pass with exact recorded coverage. Actual gaps receive bounded repair/review leaves before this parent becomes Done. No preparation, authored definition or file presence counts as runtime delivery.

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if the bound packet's required output or verification evidence is missing; any encountered issue lacks its typed Concern and disposition; any remaining work lacks explicit child/remainder tasks and appropriate BLOCKS edges; governing sources or authority boundaries were bypassed; or the affected dependent task(s) were not reviewed and updated from the completed result. A blocked or timed-out packet is not Done.
