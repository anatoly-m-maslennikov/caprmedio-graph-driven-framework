# Summary

Remove the source-publication cleanup prerequisite

## Objective

Implement the reviewed M332/D567 private reservation refinement, test no-removal publication and recovery behavior, and update exact source admission before a fresh release.

## Details

- Input: retained N22 failure, CA-C-520, unchanged R1878 preservation requirements, M332@4 and D567@6. Estimated active work: <=15 minutes; any further publication/runtime repair gets its own remainder.
- Ownership: root owns source authority, Git, admission publication and actual Runs; independent workers own only `release_delivery.py`, its test module, or the exact D572/reader/golden pin update as assigned. Preserve unrelated dirty files and all N22 staging/receipts.
- Source-first review checks the reserved-parent/absent-child layout without changing public proof schemas, fixed source-copy target, currentness, atomic renames, rollback ownership or release gates. Test first, then implement the bounded refinement and independently review it.
- Use exact source pin refresh after verified edits. Never replay N22 or report its interrupted effect as completed. A later fresh candidate independently seals current inputs; focused/local fixtures are not a complete Unit, E2E, Full Gate or release proof.

## Definition of Done

Independent source/code acceptance and regression evidence prove no empty-reservation removal prerequisite, complete nested predecessor bytes/modes, unsafe/colliding child refusal, truthful retained recovery paths and conditional rollback. Exact current source admission loads and is published through the existing authorized publisher. Any host-denied assertion remains incomplete; no release completion is inferred.

## Completion evidence

- Source packet accepted independently; code accepted at SHA256 `fb1d98e51afce8a95d60e78218b4f1be2ea8f0f618b8a879c1e09f6dee06eb11`. Source contract and implementation commits are `84827551e` and `ae641b369`.
- All 30 unchanged delivery-class fixtures passed in the existing isolated Linux executor, including actual source-copy publication, owned predecessor retention, byte/mode preservation, conditional rollback and six reservation-safety cases. Snapshot digest: `67030fbd219d64fb1a0aab0d98c2d90fb480ace17a6d6949adf8ee711db333c7`; full receipt: `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-resume-release/N23/delivery-linux-fixtures.log`. The original host setup denial remains real; this Linux fixture result does not establish host publication permission.
- D572@27 admission checks passed 14 tests. The existing guarded publisher refreshed the exact sixteen-route manifest to canonical digest `2235d03cdb904942c9b26118a867769696fbe3dfc650eebb6c2e8d49b19bbc4e` and recorded `journal:release-manifest:1223c184fcaa39ad388f764d97a10c5547434be1cc64de5b04ffae095821f291`. MCP reloaded to generation `25b3ffca06f5acad24ba8a450145b6cfc63de65685f84ada354ec68271dc8892` with unchanged registry; CA-O-164 remains bound to `release_version`.
- A separate aggregate diagnostic had 79 image/initialization fixture setup errors because its engine-only snapshot omitted required bindings. That diagnostic remains failed, not a Unit/E2E gate or release proof. N22 remains interrupted; no N23 was queued, no release gate was waived, and C520 retains the host publication blocker.
