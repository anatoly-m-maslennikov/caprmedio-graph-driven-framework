# Summary

Complete Release admission serialization

## Objective

Within <=10 minutes, complete the rejected Release source-admission serialization.

## Details

P1674 rejected only the missing D571 pin, underdefined exact D572 record/container/step-action/RMED shape, and stale R1847 D521@5 citation. Repair those source claims and preserve exact predecessor archives. Reuse current pin-object encoding and one canonical successor selected-workflow manifest; bind actual accepted child-only compiler D571@2, original13 registry, current P1618/P1535 query admissions and frozen N/N+1. No code, manifest, runtime, queue, Journal or Git writes. One Agent owns D572 and the exact R1847 citation/source change. Record uncertain schema choice in C458 if confidence is below90, choose the simplest closed coherent shape, and continue.

## Definition of Done

Exact saved hashes and complete unambiguous closed schema permit P1674's narrow independent re-review. File presence alone is not acceptance or dispatch.

## Result

The exact closed additive serialization is repaired and independently accepted through P1674. D572@3 `fb3e91bb5bee075c6394ac9a490b8599cd5cc8a9a86e7893f52e483556847b22` carries the complete twenty-pin RMED frontier including D571@2, exact ordered Step/Action occurrences, optional canonical-manifest container and six-field closed record. R1847@7 `cd8f8f100560a0beeb0254e78b74d17a2b0f92050bd6b18b264c15659061dc5a` delegates the current frontier rather than duplicating it. No uncertain schema choice remained below90%; C458 was not created. No manifest/runtime dispatch occurred.
