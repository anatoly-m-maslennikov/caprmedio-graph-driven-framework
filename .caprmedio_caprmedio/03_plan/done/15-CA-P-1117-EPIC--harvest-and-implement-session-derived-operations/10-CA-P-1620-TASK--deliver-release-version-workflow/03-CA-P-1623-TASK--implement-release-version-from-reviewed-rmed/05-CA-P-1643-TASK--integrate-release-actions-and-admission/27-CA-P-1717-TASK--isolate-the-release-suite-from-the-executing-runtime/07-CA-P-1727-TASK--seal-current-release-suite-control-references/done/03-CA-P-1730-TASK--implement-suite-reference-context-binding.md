# Summary

Implement suite reference-context binding

## Objective

Implement the accepted evaluator-owned reference context and integrate it into the immutable suite envelope and evidence.

## Details

Capture only the exact privately derived control closure, materialize it read-only, bind its digest and reject changed inputs before acceptance. Preserve package and image outputs and create no public selector or route. Expected bounded effort <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The owned work is independently accepted and its real verification result is saved. Source or mock proof alone does not close the actual Release gate.

## Results

The independently accepted helper captures a closed descriptor-safe immutable snapshot without process-global reader mutation. The Suite Owner copies that context, binds its normalized digest in schema-2 envelope/evidence, and freshly revalidates trusted candidate/compilation/N/image bindings immediately before and after execution. Focused verification is saved in 689dd212f; no Docker success is claimed.
