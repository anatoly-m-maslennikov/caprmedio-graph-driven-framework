# Summary

Test the private Candidate E2E executor

## Objective

Build mocked golden and driver tests for the complete bounded Candidate E2E contract before implementation.

## Details

Own E2E executor/driver/context test modules and golden fixtures, not production. Check three source pins, exact image, environment/argv/scratch limits, real testcase/JUnit outcomes, skips, zero-case coverage, timeout/overflow, tamper/cross-binding and no promotion. ETA <=15 minutes; no live Docker.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.

## Required decomposition

This composite is not one executable <=15-minute leaf. Complete CA-P-1750, CA-P-1751; each owns the files and acceptance stated in its carrier. Prototype/import checks already occurred but are not the complete behavioral test prerequisite. No actual Docker or publication failure is bypassed. The composite remains Active until every required child is Done.

## Recorded verification

Local implementation acceptance is saved in 7874fc864 and 5e0dfee93. The complete private gate module passed 11/11 tests after bounded failed/malformed/empty JUnit retention was fixed; the affected method also passed independently. Narrow D582#10 review accepted the final branch. Earlier context/Driver/phase-map, Runtime image-binding and actual stdio transport results remain retained. Synthetic image/command observations are mock data, not Docker or Release proof. No full-suite, installation, promotion or retirement result is claimed.
