# Summary

Accept private host E2E implementation and golden proof

## Objective

Integrate the two implementation slices with completed P1751 behavioral results and obtain independent bounded code/RMED/D582 acceptance. Preserve all real-environment blockers rather than marking synthetic command tests as actual full-suite evidence.

## Details

Ownership: RELEASE_VERSION/The three private E2E modules and owned golden tests, read-only final review. Expected execution slice <=15 minutes. Workers share the checkout and preserve edits outside their exclusive scope. Root owns integration and Git. Source/currentness, permission and missing evidence guards remain intact.

## Definition of Done

All specified local cases pass and independent review accepts actual source. Parent P1745 remains Active until this leaf passes; actual Docker remains a separate gate.

## Pre-execution review

Root selects this bounded decomposition to finish the accepted R1890/M346/E589/D582 contract, not a narrower smoke-test substitute. Existing retained N, public routes, pending Runs and canonical Journal history remain protected.

## Recorded verification

Local implementation acceptance is saved in 7874fc864 and 5e0dfee93. The complete private gate module passed 11/11 tests after bounded failed/malformed/empty JUnit retention was fixed; the affected method also passed independently. Narrow D582#10 review accepted the final branch. Earlier context/Driver/phase-map, Runtime image-binding and actual stdio transport results remain retained. Synthetic image/command observations are mock data, not Docker or Release proof. No full-suite, installation, promotion or retirement result is claimed.
