# Summary

independently review query workflow closure

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, independently review closure evidence for the two new query Workflows only. No implementation, source repair, Docker rerun, or Epic closure claim.

### Exact inputs, output, ownership, and gate

Inputs: saved P1521–P1528 results; current active source/RMED/D547/D548 exact IDs/Versions/paths and archives; retained fresh-image evidence. P1528 is a true dispatch blocker. Output: an independent accepted/rejected coverage disposition mapping each Workflow to O/RMED, Tool, discovery/MCP/orchestrator/shared-Journal route, image, Workflow/Action records, and results.

Verify source truth; canonical Events Journal-only access; Artifact frontmatter/heading and Event-field selection; default IDs and selected fetch; grammar and diagnostics; immutable-image execution; no credentials/secrets, arbitrary evaluation, mutation authority, invented Runs or query-snapshot drift; and no duplicate server/executor. Any gap has a typed Concern and blocks final image-coverage review and P1124.

### Definition of Done

An independent, evidence-pinned acceptance or truthful rejection is saved; this task never closes CA-P-1117 itself.
