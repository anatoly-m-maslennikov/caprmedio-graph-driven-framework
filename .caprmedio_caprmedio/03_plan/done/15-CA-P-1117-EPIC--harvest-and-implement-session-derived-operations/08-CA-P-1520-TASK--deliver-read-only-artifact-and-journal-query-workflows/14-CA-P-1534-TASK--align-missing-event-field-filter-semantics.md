# Summary

Align missing Event field filter semantics

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, repair the single confirmed source conflict rejected by P1533.

## Details

Own only current CA-R-1869 and CA-E-575, their @2 predecessor archives, and one new CA-C-438 Conflict in TOOLS. Read shared R1850@2 and P1533 rejection. A syntactically valid event:/ JSON Pointer absent from an individual Event follows shared missing=false comparison semantics; invalid namespace/escaping/syntax is rejected. Add an explicit missing-versus-null golden case. Do not modify R1850 or invent a local grammar, Tool or Journal. Source edits require Version bump and preserved predecessor; Summary unchanged. Publish exact current SHA-256 pins. Confidence 90%; check active Principles before a question.

### Definition of Done

The exact bounded result, changed files, source pins and actual verification are saved with truthful remainder. No broader implementation or immutable-image proof is implied.

## Result

Source repair complete by `/root/repair_missing_event_field`: CA-R-1869@3 (`03f44ef2543d2138b858516a7b908fcba8da4fbbd25c2d11852c84e2336ef2f9`) and CA-E-575@3 (`30da391211d0a2623387f54fffbf8a267e11ef6012f1cba31e1e296773b31de5`) preserve their Summaries and align valid per-Event absence with R1850's false comparison, distinct from explicit null. Invalid selector syntax remains rejected. Their @2 archive bytes exactly retain rejected hashes; CA-C-438 is resolved for this source fix. Scoped diff check passes. Fresh P1535 acceptance remains mandatory; no implementation or runtime proof claimed.
