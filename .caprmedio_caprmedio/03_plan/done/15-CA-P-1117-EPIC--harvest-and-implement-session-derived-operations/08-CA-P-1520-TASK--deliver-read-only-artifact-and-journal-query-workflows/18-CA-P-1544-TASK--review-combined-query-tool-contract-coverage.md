# Summary

Review combined query Tool contract coverage

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, complete this one bounded required Epic remainder with saved source-bound evidence.

## Details

Inputs: current returned CA-P-1537/CA-P-1538 Artifact/shared-parser implementation and CA-P-1526 Journal implementation; accepted CA-P-1532/CA-P-1535 exact source pins; all CA-E-569 and CA-E-575 through CA-E-580 obligations and directly bound R/M/D. Root reran combined Artifact/filter 15 tests and Journal 8 tests successfully in the development Docker worker; green counts are not acceptance. Read-only ownership, no file writes, worker dispatches, source fixes, Journal/Run writes or paid Agent calls. Independently inspect both Tools, sole parser, tests and actual APIs: malformed/duplicate input, identities, all selectors/short circuit, nested escaping, YAML resource safety, stable exact snapshots and continuation, configured budgets/diagnostics, defaults/selected/full fetch, secrets/ancestor selection, path/symlink/root boundaries, no source mutation, capture before execution, and truthful failure/coverage. Run disposable golden probes if needed, no real Project mutation. Return ACCEPT or REJECT for each Tool and parser separately, exact actionable gaps and test-to-E obligation mapping. Clearly keep shared real-Run journaling/MCP and fresh-image proof as separate CA-P-1527/1528 gates; absence of that integration is not falsely a completed E580 runtime proof. Root records dispositions and any bounded fix Tasks.

Inherit CA-P-1117's 90% confidence threshold and explicit mechanical Git save exception. You are not alone; preserve other workers' edits and use apply_patch. No harvesting, FPF, broader audit, permission bypass, deployment or unrelated changes. Root owns Plan updates and commits. If this bounded packet is incomplete, return exact remainder without claiming Done.

### Definition of Done

The owned packet has actual scoped verification and a truthful saved result with exact changed or reviewed files; aggregate all-fifteen Docker/MCP proof remains separate.

### Actual independent disposition

The read-only review is complete. Artifact Tool: REJECT for E569's missing same-spelling frontmatter/section fixture, with no implementation defect established. Journal Tool: REJECT for caller-forgeable snapshots and incorrect token-consumption evidence. Shared parser: ACCEPT for its currently implemented bounded grammar.

The reviewer reproduced source_root ".", zero members and a caller-rehashed INJECTED record returning status complete. It also observed a three-token expression reported as thirty UTF-8 bytes. These contradict the accepted canonical-Journal/provenance and configured-budget contracts, not merely hypothetical hardening preferences.

Required missing Tool fixtures cover Journal arrays/objects, timeout and finding limits, malformed/missing-ID/unreadable inputs, complete budget evidence, forged members/records/roots and protected-sentinel access counts. E578/E580 actual admitted shared-Run/standalone/MCP proof remains CA-P-1527; pure-core tests do not claim that gate.

CA-C-440 and CA-C-441 preserve the findings. CA-P-1545 repairs the Journal core, CA-P-1546 adds the Artifact fixture, CA-P-1548 exposes actual sole-parser consumption, and CA-P-1547 independently accepts the repaired packet before CA-P-1525/1526/1527 close or execute dependent integration. Done here means the review was performed, not that rejected Tools are admitted.
