# Summary

Restore the exact prompt reference closure

## Objective

repair the two declared Prompt binding carriers and their explicit active source pins without relaxing the accepted release or source-currentness boundaries.

## Details

- this bounded lane feeds a fresh source-bound N10; retain failed N9 without replay.
- root owns Git, integration, source pins, canonical refresh and actual dispatch. workers preserve other lanes' changes.
- local fixture/source acceptance is not full Release acceptance; installed N remains unchanged.

## Definition of Done

source-first R1887/M344/E587/D580 and D572v11 are independently accepted and committed at 6500fa7d4. fifteen full reference-context cases and fourteen source-admission cases pass. the exact two Prompt binding carriers and their 125 explicit active pins are captured descriptor-first and revalidated in the existing schema-1 reference_rows union; no public schema, arbitrary discovery or retained-N currentness boundary changed. strict sixteen-route admission was refreshed through the separately approved guarded publisher, with one linked canonical completed carrier event. full candidate Unit acceptance remains CA-P-1782's later gate.
