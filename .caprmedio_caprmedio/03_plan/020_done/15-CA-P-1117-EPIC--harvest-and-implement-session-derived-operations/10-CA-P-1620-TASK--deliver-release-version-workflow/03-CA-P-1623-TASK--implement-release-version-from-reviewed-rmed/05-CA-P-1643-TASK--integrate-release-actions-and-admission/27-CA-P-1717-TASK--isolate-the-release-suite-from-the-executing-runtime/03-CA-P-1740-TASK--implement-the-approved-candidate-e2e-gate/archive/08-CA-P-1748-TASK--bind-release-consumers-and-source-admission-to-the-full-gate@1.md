# Summary

Bind Release consumers and source admission to the Full Gate

## Objective

Integrate candidate image, Release Actions, promotion and explicit source admission with the accepted two-phase gate.

## Details

Own bounded Release consumers/checkpoint adapters plus reviewed D572 source-frontier amendment and subsequent admission rebind only after prerequisite acceptance. Preserve N, pending Runs, current public manifest and rollback. No silent frontier widening or generic remote Docker interface. ETA <=15 minutes; split further if needed.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.
