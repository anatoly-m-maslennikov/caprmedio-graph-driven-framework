# Summary

Bind the three E2E harnesses to sealed context

## Objective

Run each declared E2E harness only against the sealed candidate image and dedicated writable scratch.

## Details

Own only the three APP/WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR E2E harness files and necessary bounded Runtime constructor binding/tests. Remove mutable-tag admission and ambient opt-in acceptance; source workspace remains sealed read-only. Coordinate exact context API with P1745. ETA <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.
