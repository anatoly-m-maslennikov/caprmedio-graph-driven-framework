# Summary

Author the bounded Candidate E2E contract

## Objective

Define independently reviewed R1890/M346/E589/D582, literal private-driver bindings and configurable Framework Instance limits.

## Details

Own only the new E2E source packet, canonical release_e2e defaults and release_e2e_bindings.json. Use actual unittest.TestResult-based JUnit. ETA <=15 minutes. Acceptance requires independent source review; creation alone is not acceptance.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and actual scoped verification is saved. Mock or source acceptance does not close live Docker, complete-suite, installation or promotion gates.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded decomposition of the Operator-approved host E2E design. Respect the stated dependency and file-ownership boundaries. The existing isolated Unit executor, current public manifest, pending Runs and retained N remain protected.
