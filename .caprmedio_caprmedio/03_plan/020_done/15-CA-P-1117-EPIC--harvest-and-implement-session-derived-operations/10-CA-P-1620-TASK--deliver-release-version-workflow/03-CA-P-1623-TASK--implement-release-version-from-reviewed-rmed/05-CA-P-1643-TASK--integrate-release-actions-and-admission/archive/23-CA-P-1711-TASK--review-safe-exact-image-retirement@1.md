# Summary

Review safe exact image retirement

## Objective

Within <=8 minutes, independently review only P1707's consequential exact-removal delta against accepted D573@2 and Release safety authority.

## Details

Read-only review of release_image.py SHA14d196bafe451085a3c6f7de4cd5f3fac4cec27a8deac5f1ccd848d06b1eae3c and testsbac6e8970a65510377ed45c9ac487749673e7432980e3ff043e34a8e77917b29. Current reported51 fake-image and14 promotion cases pass. Check actual digest-matched settings, successful same-candidate suite/image/promotion, required-ref/all-container observation, no candidate/unknown/tag/force/prune deletion, exact before/after CLI proof and durable concurrency/uncertain replay limits. Identify concrete counterexamples only; no broad audit or real Docker operation. Missing same-intent recording reconciliation stays explicit rather than becoming a fabricated pass.

## Definition of Done

Save exact ACCEPT/REJECT, focused evidence/confidence and blocking findings. Actual image, full Release and provider/runtime gates remain separate.
