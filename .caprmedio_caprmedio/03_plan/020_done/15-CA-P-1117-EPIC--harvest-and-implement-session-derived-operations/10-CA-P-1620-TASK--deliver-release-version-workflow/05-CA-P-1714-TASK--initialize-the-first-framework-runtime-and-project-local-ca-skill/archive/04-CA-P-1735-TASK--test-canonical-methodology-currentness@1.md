# Summary

Test canonical Methodology currentness

## Objective

Test read-only proof that canonical compiled Methodology matches its complete current source frontier.

## Details

Own tests/test_framework_compiler_currentness.py and its minimal configured fixture. Cover exact current output, missing/extra/stale outputs, path/mode/snapshot mutations and nonzero conflicts without compiler publication. Expected bounded effort: <=15 minutes; decompose further if necessary.

## Definition of Done

The owned source or implementation is independently accepted and its real verification result is saved. Source or mock proof alone does not close actual first-install or Release gates.
