# Summary

review shared selected run rmed

## Objective

Independently review one exact native RMED packet before its implementation. Estimate <=15 minutes; threshold 90%. No harvesting, FPF, broad source audit, code edits or additional delivery scope.

### Exact inputs

P1484 Done; current TOOLS-root carriers with those exact IDs; J01–J08 in P1443/P1451; R1720/R1525/R1728/R1643/R1644/R1094 current revisions.

Bound packet IDs: R1821–1824, E541–544, D527–529. Re-read the active Operator Goal and directly relevant Project Principles (Operator authority, DRY, necessary complexity, rebuildability and capabilities without forced execution). Current saved sources govern; preparation summaries do not replace them.

### Check and output

Read all eleven saved carriers. Check immutable schema-v5 events versus receipt state, standalone/nested Run identity and lineage, failed/uncompleted partial effects versus successful completion, same-event recording retry without effect replay, authorization/currentness before actual dispatch, and compatibility with existing Journal append/receipt behavior.

Read the full bound saved carriers and return a compact evidence-backed PASS or exact blocking corrections, with actual carrier versions and uncovered obligations. A section/metadata check alone is not semantic acceptance. Root records the actual independent result here and owns any separately bound correction and dependent readiness. The reviewer is not the packet's author. Preserve all other work.

## Details

### Actual independent result

Independent terra_reviewer_xhigh review read all eleven v1 carriers and current append API. Required correction: preserve original immutable append context (author/local_date/timezone) and global Event-ID receipt/collision safety after restart/date rollover; test post-fsync/pre-receipt ambiguity plus identical/conflicting retry without effects replay. P1502 binds this and the P1499 shared execute-envelope seam. Other admission, lineage, truthful terminal and immutable receipt separation checks passed. Runtime remains untested.

Disposition: required correction/re-acceptance pending; this review leaf remains Active and implementation is gated.

### Definition of Done

The complete bound packet has an actual independent semantic result, retained findings/dispositions and concrete dependent readiness. Missing coverage or unresolved blocking corrections keep this leaf unfinished. No runtime completion is claimed by an RMED review.
