# Summary

Centralize persisted Project Projection carriers

## Objective

Within <=15 minutes, complete this one required implementation remainder with source-bound evidence.

## Details

Inputs: current CA-D-550, authoritative Project Structure delivery bindings, current P1117 cutover frontier and all persisted Project view Projections. Ownership: only relocation of persisted view carriers from old Project paths into .caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection and the narrow migration helper/map under tmp or _projection/migration. Do not edit authoritative Atoms, Settings, Structure, Journals, native I, Plans, MCP/queue code or canonical selected_workflow_bindings.json. Current _journal is already byte-verified and committed: never rerun its old rename or touch its files. Old Applicable Methodology role directories (not 000_APPLICABLE_MTHD_sources) move under _projection/APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY. Rebase only their source_carrier_path relative paths so each still resolves to the same original authoritative Atom; preserve other projected content. Existing registered *.projection.* persistent views, including historical execution evidence, move under a deterministic relative-path-preserving hierarchy at _projection. Preserve their historical payload bytes and produce a mapping old path -> new path with exact SHA-256 proof. Preserve .DS_Store untouched; do not include it in evidence. The old Engine selected_workflow_bindings.json differs from the canonical manifest: retain it as historical under _projection/legacy/selected_workflow_bindings.original_thirteen.json, never overwrite or merge the live canonical manifest. Verify current selected loaders already read only the canonical path before moving its obsolete predecessor. Current and historical reference reconciliation is a separately saved follow-up, not a fabricated byte-preservation proof. Refuse symlinks/collisions/missing targets; no permission bypass, no broad deletion. Use current live state, not tmp/centralize_project_carriers.py's obsolete Journal preconditions. Return actual move map, bytes proof, source-link validation, unresolved follow-up; no aggregate image/graph completeness claim.

Inherit CA-P-1117's 90% confidence threshold and mechanical Git save exception. You are not alone; preserve concurrent changes and use apply_patch. Root owns Plan writes and commits. No harvesting, FPF, unrelated audit, permission bypass, deployment or unsupported completion claim. Return exact remainder if the bounded packet cannot finish.

### Definition of Done

Actual changed carriers and source-bound verification are saved truthfully. Final all-fifteen Docker/MCP proof remains a separate required gate.

### Partial Result

102 registered historical Projection files were relocated and byte-verified against their predecessor: 55,288,394 bytes, zero mismatches. Those completed moves are now preserved in 615b49250. The first Applicable Methodology role-directory rename raised PermissionError; execution stopped without retry or bypass. Its 963 projected source links remain valid at the original locations, but no Applicable Methodology relocation or rebasing occurred. The legacy Engine manifest remains distinct from the canonical manifest and untouched. No full migration map was saved before failure. CA-P-1556 records the partial accounting without repeating the denied operation. This Task remains Active and does not claim completed migration.
