# Summary

Review implemented code against RMED and Operations

## Objective

Review the approved first usable capability cut against its current applicable RMED and O Atoms. The required review covers only that cut, not formal N+1 release acceptance or the former all-sixteen-Workflow review.

## Details

The approved review frontier is exactly six Workflows: Create Atom, Update Atom, Replace Atom, Change Atom Status, Implementation, and Build Applicable Methodology. Review their actually used RMED/O, code, stdio MCP, orchestrator and Journal paths, including success, no-op and relevant failure records. The functional boundary also includes Docker HTTP MCP authentication, initialize/list/call/health/lifecycle and invalid credential, Host and Origin refusal.

The retained review records the exact source/code frontier and governing Atom identities for this cut. It does not assert a formal full N+1 release, all-sixteen-Workflow coverage, or closure of Automated Release, Scope mutations, Revert, graphs, standalone query branches or additional recovery hardening. Those remain deferred work, not accepted behavior.

### Historical review checkpoints

- the six retained Workflows passed the disposable Docker stdio native-effect, source-graph, and shared Run Journal test at Engine commit `38b1d7319`, immutable development image `sha256:46ddf9480372160f0d435d6e03e7bcf358c542ce59659ce71ff269103c3dc9a0`. the aggregate test exited 0 after 133.220 seconds. Implementation used the explicit golden mock Agent, not a live LLM. the detailed receipt is `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/stdio-six-workflows-38b1d7319.log`.
- this receipt covers those six happy cases only. it does not establish every Status, lifecycle composition, proposed direct Relation, or HTTP security case.
- the bounded source review found a missing canonical file-change producer for Update/Status composition, valid direct Relation/nested Plan admission gaps, and incomplete HTTP denial/token-rotation assertions. these are required first-cut repairs, not optional Tool expansion.
- current repair commits include `45ea43214` (evidenced carrier-only baseline authority), `97ec979c3` (truthful interrupted public status), `770afde12` (HTTP denial and token-rotation tests), `53487ee4c` (finite Relation authority pins), `7d5370e89` (complete Status fixtures), and `4ab862ec6` (exact proposed-target inventory). implementation and fresh integrated acceptance remain unfinished.
- the current all-role Status diagnostic at `7d5370e89`, image `sha256:a0a5068cf354d431270f39d5df793cb84cecb99c39e72bc474a05b0d443c989e`, passed image isolation and stale compilation-source refusal. its Status matrix stopped at an incorrect test expectation: the actual unchanged-Status Run recorded `no_op`, while the helper expected `completed`. the failed aggregate receipt remains `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/boundaries-7d5370e89.log`; the unexecuted remainder is not passed.
- real localhost HTTP proof remains unavailable because the active host profile denies the direct loopback connection. synthetic HTTP tests are not a substitute. the prepared Terminal proof must target the final exact development image after the remaining repairs; installed N is unchanged.

### Current accepted first-cut evidence

Engine code is frozen at `1bfab3e78`, in unselected development image `sha256:a363a23108aa9c28acbe8e7c5bb9bb5cd2530fb4c6187811c317b362e4520fc2`. this is a disposable test candidate, not installed N+1 or formal release promotion.

| Reviewed boundary | Accepted repair / evidence |
| --- | --- |
| W09 source graph and W13 partial-effect classification | `7ff886387`; current O016 graph/revisits, and stale applied output retains truthful partial effects |
| W02 rollback and mutable before-state | `a142e7eea`; exact restoration or preserved uncertainty/history, not silent loss |
| W09 malformed Agent result | `b000005f1`; actually observed effects retained |
| HTTP empty-token factory | `b1106f2c5`; empty/missing credentials cannot admit handlers |
| Complete Create/Replace carriers and existing direct Relations | `a3b53639c`, `7286176be`, `093174c59`, `1bfab3e78`; full supplied carriers preflighted; current targets and nested Plan placement resolved |
| Canonical lifecycle / replacement records and actual child Runs | `7be2e970e`, `c8ee3c1c2`, `c56c8a6b7`, `d48de086c`, `d8a5ffba0`; observed baselines, changes, replacement provenance and native child lineage |
| Every current Content Role's Status model | `1bfab3e78`; literal lowercase Concern domain preserved; D324 final Operations entry parsed from source, not omitted |
| Final bounded source acceptance | final wrapper, target inventory and lifecycle hashes accepted by the independent read-only reviewer; no invented domain or source-authority bypass |

The bounded seven-finding source review is retained at `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/scoped-review.md`. its original findings are historical, and the accepted repair table above records their disposition. the Epic's explicit mechanical-Git exception is retained; it is not an invented save-Tool intake or Journal receipt.

| Functional evidence | Result / retained receipt |
| --- | --- |
| Native carrier/status/reference/Plan and lifecycle composition | 26 tests passed in 93.815 seconds; `native-status-and-composition-final.log`, SHA-256 `7b2c05b9c7e307882b30ca234b88c3fc1eb1df966cb496e3c22a24e4a33af4c8` |
| Six retained Workflows over Docker stdio MCP | passed in 155.939 seconds; `stdio-six-workflows-1bfab3e78.log`, SHA-256 `9f1c9f2f59bac99c64cc8e86b324ea4766368db63381ce0a2aa46d3a7575b469` |
| Requirement / Method / Evaluation / Delivery Status shard | passed in 311.761 seconds; `status-1bfab3e78-a.log`, SHA-256 `c82f685e62f26b77b6194a4a168cfb3dcbfffb94fe38012ad1fcb0b164cbd19d` |
| Plan / Concern / Operations / Analysis Status shard, image isolation and stale-source refusal | passed in 363.745 seconds; `status-1bfab3e78-b.log`, SHA-256 `bfaef09fad75603455bc31af50605eb037e6a21e87210a0f866990c576f9c8cb` |
| Six-route replay with actual fixture evidence retained | passed in 124.608 seconds; `stdio-six-workflows-1bfab3e78-retained.log`, SHA-256 `4320d6da6b1991e2b89cd7f5da8a764cef311c6308f657259b1dd9cab1483e36` |

All receipt filenames above are under `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/`. the two Status shards exactly partition all eight Content Roles: 27 admitted transitions, eight no-ops and eight invalid-Status refusals. invalid requests preserved both authority and recording snapshots. the isolated-image and stale compilation-source checks passed without undeclared host Implementation or mutation effects.

The retained canonical Journal/result/effect files live under `stdio-1bfab3e78-retained/selected-workflows-docker-e2e/`. their observed terminal index is `retained-workflow-receipts.json`, SHA-256 `9a3866d6b440584feac03a06460b2e9f4d4395a0389e47dac528ffae2ed4a244`: six actual Workflow terminals (`golden-w01-happy`, `golden-w02-happy`, `golden-w03-happy`, `golden-w04-happy`, `golden-w09-happy`, `golden-w13-happy`) and 18 actual Action terminals, with definition pins, event digests, parent identities and retained result/effect references. these are disposable test Runs, not production Runs. the Implementation case used the explicit golden mock Agent, not a live LLM.

### Remaining acceptance blocker

Actual Docker localhost HTTP proof is still unaccepted: this session's direct host loopback connection is denied by its permission profile. synthetic authentication / Host / Origin / token-rotation / lifecycle checks do not substitute for it. `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/run-http-proof.sh` targets the exact image above, retains its fixture evidence and is ready for the Operator's Terminal. this Task and Epic closure remain Active until that actual proof is received. all test services have been stopped; installed N, historical failed receipts and deferred work are preserved.


## Definition of Done

This Plan may be Done only after the six-Workflow frontier has explicit RMED/O-to-code coverage, functional stdio MCP/orchestrator/Journal evidence, and Docker HTTP MCP protocol/authentication evidence with truthful success, no-op and failure dispositions. This scope amendment does not establish that evidence; deferred branches and any formal release/Epic closure remain outside it.
