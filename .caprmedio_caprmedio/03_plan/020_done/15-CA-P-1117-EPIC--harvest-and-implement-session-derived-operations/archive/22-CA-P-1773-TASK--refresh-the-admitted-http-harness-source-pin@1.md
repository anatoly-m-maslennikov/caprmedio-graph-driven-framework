# Summary

Refresh the admitted HTTP Harness source pin

## Objective

Bind the new accepted HTTP case in the existing mandatory Docker Harness without weakening its exact source admission.

## Details

Root owns CA-D-572 private Harness metadata and the matching release_source_admission.py trust anchor. Only the existing test_docker_e2e.py byte pin and timestamp change; D572's Claim, closed schema, twelve occurrences, source frontier and Version 10 remain unchanged. This is carrier/source-pin recoding, not a new Workflow definition. Independent read-only review verifies that exact delta before a fresh release dispatch. Estimated slice <=15 minutes.

## Definition of Done

The private pins reopen successfully, the unchanged sixteen-route manifest remains valid, focused admission tests pass and independent review accepts. No stale-pin guard is bypassed and no historical Run is rebound.

## Pre-execution review

Root selects this necessary mechanical pin refresh under the accepted E584/E585 HTTP proof, DRY and current source authority. Actual Docker verification remains P1757.
