# Summary

Prove the localhost HTTP MCP Docker path

## Objective

Verify the opt-in HTTP service in an actual isolated candidate container with an explicit loopback port and ephemeral test token.

## Details

Root owns actual Docker effects; current accepted HTTP packet and P1756 gate execution. Disposable project and explicit runtime environment only; no Codex Agent start or host socket mount.

Estimated bounded slice: <=15 minutes. Workers share the checkout, preserve other edits and do not stage or commit. Root owns integration and Git. Preparation does not prove runtime execution.

## Definition of Done

Actual authenticated initialize/list/call, health and lifecycle tests pass on localhost; invalid credentials/Host/Origin fail before tools; stdio stays usable; retain bounded evidence.

## Pre-execution review

Root accepts this bounded repair/restoration against Operator authority, DRY, preservation of valuable information and the latest continuation. Keep installed N intact and distinguish local tests from required actual runtime gates.
