# Summary

Verify project-wide traceability and close the epic

## Objective

Verify an exact sixteen-Workflow coverage matrix under current CA-P-1117v14 and CA-P-1620v1 from current source Operations through reviewed RMED, implementation, Docker/MCP execution, Workflow/Action Run Journal records, and results before closing CA-P-1117. Check all three Projection builds and source traceability, approved Revert, identity-preserving Update versus Replace, applicable status models, Scope Unit changes, and the two read-only query Workflows. For query coverage, prove current Events Journal is the only Journal source, arbitrary frontmatter/heading properties and requested statuses are not silently excluded, boolean filter grammar is unambiguous and non-evaluating, default ID and optional selected fetch behavior is correct, malformed-carrier/missing-ID/duplicate-heading-or-property/incomplete-read diagnostics prevent false completeness, and a query neither returns credentials/secrets nor creates mutation authority or fictitious Runs.

Retain historical harvest and additional authored work with their truthful dispositions. CA-P-1118 and CA-P-1131's excluded legacy closure are not required completion; CA-C-410 remains an unresolved but nonblocking historical placement defect for this amended scope. Do not call these Done or claim their failures fixed. A finding that affects an actual selected execution path still blocks that path.

### Work decomposition

This is a composite task, not a fifteen-minute executable leaf. Its initial child files partition the work; add more <=15-minute one-file subtasks for remaining evidence, capability slices, reviews or failures. Roll-up effort depends on the frozen inventory. Inherit CA-P-1117 execution controls and its autonomous-confidence threshold; do not copy or override inherited values.

Before marking this task Done, verify full-stage coverage and update the next dependent task(s) from actual results. A blocked child remains unfinished, has a C/Problem, and does not authorize bypassing this parent's gate.

## Details

Final coverage verification and Epic closure are temporarily deferred by the Operator's direction to skip queue item #5 for now. This Task remains unfinished; its acceptance requirements are retained and no closure is claimed. The implementation and required runtime tests continue separately.

### Sixteenth Workflow closure mapping

The final matrix must add Release Version without relabeling the earlier fifteen-route evidence. Map the executing N and candidate N+1 separately to exact source/Version, accepted O/RMED and additive route admission, implementation, release notes, package manifest/digests, copied-source and compiled/runtime delivery destinations, full-suite results, project-local ca Skill target, current image/container references, rollback/retirement state, actual Workflow/Action Run IDs and canonical Journal/report evidence.

Verify the full Methodology source copy at root `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`, accepted compilation from those pinned sources and consistent runtime-consumed Methodology under `.caprmedio_caprmedio/000_CAPRMEDIO_framework`. Source review must reconcile the existing Structure delivery binding and settle exact compiled layout before effects. Verify the full declared Framework package under `.caprmedio_runtime`, including Methodology, Engine, Tools, applications, MCP, Skills and required resources, rather than an Engine-only delivery. Installed source/package copies remain derived; upstream authoring sources and the single canonical Journal/Projection authority remain intact.

Release closure requires the full declared test-suite results, actual package/installation/MCP and rebuilt current-image functional proof, and project-local ca Skill installation without hooks. Preserve settings, authoring sources, Journals, unrelated Skills and rollback state; no secrets or undeclared host-code dependencies enter the package/image. Check required failure, currentness, partial-effect, rollback and recording-recovery cases, not only a successful build or mock/source test.

The release Run freezes executing N's implementation, Methodology and definitions independently of candidate N+1's sources/package. N builds and tests the candidate without changing its own running graph. Promote N+1 only after required gates pass, retaining N as working runtime/rollback until then; do not use recursive release invocation as first-cut proof. After successful verification, exact prior-image retirement must verify no container or required rollback reference still needs it; protected or pending retirement is not reported performed. No force removal or broad pruning.

The existing fifteen-route manifest/admission remains valid for its accepted closed scope until independent additive source/route acceptance. Preserve original fifteen-route evidence with its exact source/image/Run bounds; later source or Engine changes and this sixteenth capability require their own current proof. Independent release source/implementation/functional coverage dispositions must be available before final stage/Epic acceptance; this amendment supplies no runtime pass.

### Preserved blocking dispositions and predecessor

CA-C-447/CA-P-1549's denied role-directory relocation and CA-C-449's unavailable host Docker/MCP test environment remain active blockers where required. Preserve completed partial moves, byte proofs, original links and retained failed-environment evidence; no denied retry, alternate relocation, rebasing, environment-permission bypass, stale-worker substitute or build-only completion is authorized. These are distinct from excluded harvest/legacy administrative work and cannot be silently made nonblocking by adding Release Version.

Exact committed P1124v4 predecessor from `0ca6fcf2b9a4d44a96e3661d0a389dc9a700eff7` is preserved byte-for-byte at `archive/07-CA-P-1124-TASK--verify-project-wide-traceability-and-close-the-epic@4.md`. Identity, Summary, decomposition and all existing query/exclusion gates are preserved. Status remains Active; root retains Task result recording, independent closure and dependent bindings.

### Definition of Done

CA-P-1655 is a required final review gate: consume its current code-versus-RMED/O report, exact source/code frontier and blocking-finding dispositions before closure. A pending, partial or rejected review prevents this Plan and the Epic from being Done.

This Plan is not Done until all required stages/leaves are Done and every one of the sixteen selected Workflows has exact reviewed-source, RMED, implementation, image, Run/Action Journal and passing result evidence. Projections must remain derived, all required supporting paths covered and blocking findings resolved. The two query Workflows require P1529's independent closure review in addition to their source, Tool, discovery/MCP/orchestrator/shared-Journal, and fresh-image evidence. Release Version also requires exact full-source/compilation/package/Skill-no-hooks/full-suite/current-image/rollback/safe-retirement evidence, frozen executing N versus candidate N+1 and independently accepted additive admission; C447/C449 remain required unresolved gates rather than historical successes. Excluded harvest/capability/administrative work stays truthfully classified with justified nonblocking dispositions; it is not inferred complete.
