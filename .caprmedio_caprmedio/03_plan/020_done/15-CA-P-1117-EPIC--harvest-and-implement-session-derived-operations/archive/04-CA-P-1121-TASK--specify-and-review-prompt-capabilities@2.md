# Summary

Specify and review PROMPTS capabilities

## Objective

Add or update and independently review RMED only for Action/Operator Prompts needed by the thirteen selected Workflows in CA-P-1117 v3, particularly the Implementation Workflow and genuinely agentic or approval-dependent Steps. Reuse existing prompts. Purely programmatic Actions do not require invented agent prompts.

Specify concise input/result handoffs, decision and permission boundaries, Update-to-Replace routing, and Run/Action identifiers needed for Journal linkage. Workflow execution order belongs to reviewed O definitions, not duplicate independent prompt procedures.

### Work decomposition

This is a composite task, not a fifteen-minute executable leaf. Its initial child files partition the work; add more <=15-minute one-file subtasks for remaining evidence, capability slices, reviews or failures. Roll-up effort depends on the frozen inventory. Inherit CA-P-1117 execution controls and its autonomous-confidence threshold; do not copy or override inherited values.

Before marking this task Done, verify full-stage coverage and update the next dependent task(s) from actual results. A blocked child remains unfinished, has a C/Problem, and does not authorize bypassing this parent's gate.

## Details

### Definition of Done

This Plan is not Done if a prompt actually required by a selected Workflow lacks reviewed RMED and findings disposition, result submission is confused with prompt delivery or Step completion, or identity/permission/Journal handoff boundaries are missing. Required leaves must be Done; unrelated prompts and gratuitous prompts for programmatic Actions are excluded.
