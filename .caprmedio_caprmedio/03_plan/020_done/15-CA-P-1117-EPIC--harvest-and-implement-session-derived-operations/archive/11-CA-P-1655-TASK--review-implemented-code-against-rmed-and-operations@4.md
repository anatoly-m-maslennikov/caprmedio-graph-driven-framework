# Summary

Review implemented code against RMED and Operations

## Objective

Review the approved first usable capability cut against its current applicable RMED and O Atoms. The required review covers only that cut, not formal N+1 release acceptance or the former all-sixteen-Workflow review.

## Details

The approved review frontier is exactly six Workflows: Create Atom, Update Atom, Replace Atom, Change Atom Status, Implementation, and Build Applicable Methodology. Review their actually used RMED/O, code, stdio MCP, orchestrator and Journal paths, including success, no-op and relevant failure records. The functional boundary also includes Docker HTTP MCP authentication, initialize/list/call/health/lifecycle and invalid credential, Host and Origin refusal.

The retained review records the exact source/code frontier and governing Atom identities for this cut. It does not assert a formal full N+1 release, all-sixteen-Workflow coverage, or closure of Automated Release, Scope mutations, Revert, graphs, standalone query branches or additional recovery hardening. Those remain deferred work, not accepted behavior.

### Recorded first-cut review progress

- the six retained Workflows passed the disposable Docker stdio native-effect, source-graph, and shared Run Journal test at Engine commit `38b1d7319`, immutable development image `sha256:46ddf9480372160f0d435d6e03e7bcf358c542ce59659ce71ff269103c3dc9a0`. the aggregate test exited 0 after 133.220 seconds. Implementation used the explicit golden mock Agent, not a live LLM. the detailed receipt is `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/stdio-six-workflows-38b1d7319.log`.
- this receipt covers those six happy cases only. it does not establish every Status, lifecycle composition, proposed direct Relation, or HTTP security case.
- the bounded source review found a missing canonical file-change producer for Update/Status composition, valid direct Relation/nested Plan admission gaps, and incomplete HTTP denial/token-rotation assertions. these are required first-cut repairs, not optional Tool expansion.
- current repair commits include `45ea43214` (evidenced carrier-only baseline authority), `97ec979c3` (truthful interrupted public status), `770afde12` (HTTP denial and token-rotation tests), `53487ee4c` (finite Relation authority pins), `7d5370e89` (complete Status fixtures), and `4ab862ec6` (exact proposed-target inventory). implementation and fresh integrated acceptance remain unfinished.
- the current all-role Status diagnostic at `7d5370e89`, image `sha256:a0a5068cf354d431270f39d5df793cb84cecb99c39e72bc474a05b0d443c989e`, passed image isolation and stale compilation-source refusal. its Status matrix stopped at an incorrect test expectation: the actual unchanged-Status Run recorded `no_op`, while the helper expected `completed`. the failed aggregate receipt remains `.caprmedio_tmp/epic-first-cut-20261008/boundaries-7d5370e89.log`; the unexecuted remainder is not passed.
- real localhost HTTP proof remains unavailable because the active host profile denies the direct loopback connection. synthetic HTTP tests are not a substitute. the prepared Terminal proof must target the final exact development image after the remaining repairs; installed N is unchanged.

## Definition of Done

This Plan may be Done only after the six-Workflow frontier has explicit RMED/O-to-code coverage, functional stdio MCP/orchestrator/Journal evidence, and Docker HTTP MCP protocol/authentication evidence with truthful success, no-op and failure dispositions. This scope amendment does not establish that evidence; deferred branches and any formal release/Epic closure remain outside it.
