# Summary

Which canonical identity should the legacy GRAPH_UI Delivery use?

## Question

Should the valid legacy identity CAPRMEDIO-FRAMEWORK-ENGINE-DELV-005 be explicitly mapped to the next unused project-wide CA-D number, retaining the exact original carrier, its Summary and Claim lineage, and the old-to-new identity binding?

## Evidence

The active carrier is under GRAPH_UI/07_delivery with basename CAPRMEDIO-FRAMEWORK-ENGINE-DELV-005-GRAPH_UI-DELIVERY--deliver-the-requirement-projection-browser-locally.md. It still prescribes .caprmedio/mrt_atoms.html and per-structural-unit STGs. No recorded current canonical identity mapping was found. CA-R-1048 requires approved legacy identity and explicit target mapping; the current sealed Update route preserves assigned CA IDs and does not assign a new identity or recode this valid legacy one. CA-R-1432 prohibits treating a meaning-preserving update as an arbitrary replacement. The Operator was asked this one mapping question on 2026-10-05.

## Disposition

Keep the original carrier unchanged while the mapping is unresolved. Do not reuse its legacy 005 component as a project-wide canonical number, infer an alias, or claim CA-C-443 is fully resolved. After an explicit decision, use the governed sealed migration boundary and preserve original evidence and Journal provenance; no direct carrier-edit bypass is authorized.
