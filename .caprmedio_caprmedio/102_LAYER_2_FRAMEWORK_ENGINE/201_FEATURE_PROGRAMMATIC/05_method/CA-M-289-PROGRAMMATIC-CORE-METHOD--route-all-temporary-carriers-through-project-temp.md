# Route all temporary Carriers through project temp

resolve the configured Project Temporary State root **before** a PROGRAMMATIC
component creates a temporary Carrier **or** invokes a dependency that can create
one. allocate a component-owned **and**, **when** concurrency is possible, run-specific
descendant below `.caprmedio_tmp/`. pass that descendant explicitly **to**
temporary-file APIs **and** configure dependency cache, temporary, staging, build,
**and** Evaluation paths **before** invocation. do **not** rely on an ambient host
temporary directory **or** the process working directory.

route Python bytecode cache output **to** `.caprmedio_tmp/cache/python/` **before**
importing Project modules, **or** disable bytecode writes for an isolated process.
do **not** create `__pycache__/` **or** `.pyc` Carriers below `.caprmedio_runtime/`.

for an atomic replacement, create its staging Carrier below the Project
Temporary State root **and** verify that the staging **and** destination Carriers satisfy the
required same-filesystem atomicity boundary **before** the first mutation. stop
**without** falling back **to** a destination sibling **or** host temporary location **when**
that precondition is false.

attempt bounded cleanup **when** the owning operation ends. treat interrupted **or**
denied cleanup as retained non-authoritative temporary state, report its owned
path, **and** leave it confined below `.caprmedio_tmp/`. never weaken placement
because cleanup is best-effort.

keep executable releases, shared implementation libraries, registries, stable
launchers, Hook Carriers, runtime logs, sessions, databases, service state,
resumable state, **and** governed Artifacts outside the Temporary State root **in**
their applicable authority **or** runtime places.
