# Reconcile independent Git and Journal provenance

## Applicable when

Apply after a sealed programmatic action changes Git-governed carriers, creates
or prepares its Journal record, or requires provenance before later reliance.

## Procedure

1. Preserve one sealed durable action state independently of Git and Journal
   writes.
2. Record whether the action is `git_complete_journal_pending`,
   `journal_recorded_git_pending`, or `reconciled`; do not treat either pending
   state as provenance loss.
3. Bind exactly one canonical Journal action record to exactly one reachable
   real-change commit once that commit SHA is known.
4. Commit the Journal carrier later in a separate Git commit. Derive the
   Journal-carrier binding from its exact revision and reachable history; do
   not embed the SHA of the commit that contains the same record.
5. Reconcile missing counterparts, duplicate bindings, revision or digest
   mismatches, and Journal-carrier watermark lag from sealed durable state.
6. Do not block the mutation that creates an action on its own reconciliation.
   Require `reconciled` before a later release, promotion-dependent action, or
   other governed reliance on that provenance.
7. Return an explicit blocked state when deterministic repair cannot establish
   one canonical record and one reachable real-change commit.

## Outcome

Git and Journal remain independent provenance systems while each sealed action
converges to one recoverable cross-system binding without a digest cycle.

## Failure or stop

Stop reliance on the affected provenance when the sealed state is absent,
multiple canonical records or commits remain, the commit is unreachable, or
revision and digest mismatches cannot be repaired deterministically.
