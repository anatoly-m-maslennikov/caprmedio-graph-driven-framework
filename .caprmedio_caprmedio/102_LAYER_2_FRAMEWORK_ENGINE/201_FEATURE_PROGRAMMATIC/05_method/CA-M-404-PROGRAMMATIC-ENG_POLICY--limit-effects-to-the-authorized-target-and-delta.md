# Summary

Limit effects to the authorized target and delta

## Scope

New or changed PROGRAMMATIC implementation, including Tools, Apps, MCP adapters and tests.

## Claim

**To** change state, bind the admitted target, explicit delta and required expected state, then apply **only** that authorized change.

## Details

Candidate source: [CA-M-388@2](archive/CA-M-388-PROGRAMMATIC-CORE--limit-effects-to-the-authorized-target-and-delta@2.md)

- Do not substitute targets, broaden the affected frontier or add semantic operations.
- Observing additional files or state does not grant permission to change them.
- An unresolved, ambiguous, stale or unsupported binding stops the affected change; it does not authorize a fallback target or broader effect.

Source basis: CA-M-376, CA-M-381.
