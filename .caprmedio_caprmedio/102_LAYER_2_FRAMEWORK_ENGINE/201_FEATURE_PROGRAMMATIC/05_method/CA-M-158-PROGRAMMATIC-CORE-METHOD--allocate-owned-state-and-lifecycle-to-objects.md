# Allocate owned state and lifecycle to objects

Introduce an object only when one PROGRAMMATIC responsibility needs identity
across calls because it owns mutable technical state, preserves an invariant,
manages a resource or lifecycle, or implements a replaceable adapter. Do not
create an object merely to group functions or to perform a bounded one-shot
effect.

## Applicable when

Apply when a Tool, App backend service, or MCP component must retain state,
preserve an invariant across calls, acquire or release a resource, transition
through a lifecycle, or encapsulate one replaceable technical adapter.

## Procedure

1. Give the class or object a specific, intention-revealing noun phrase that
   states the one state, invariant, resource, lifecycle, or adapter
   responsibility it owns; do not use an unqualified generic name such as
   `Manager`, `Helper`, or `Utils`.
2. Give each effectful method a specific verb phrase that declares the effect
   or lifecycle transition it performs.
3. Keep construction free of I/O and start acquisition or activation through
   an explicit method.
4. Make acquisition, use, failure, and release or recovery boundaries
   explicit.
5. Keep deterministic transformations outside the object unless they require
   its owned responsibility.
6. Compose the object from explicit collaborators instead of inheriting
   behavior for code reuse.
7. Use inheritance only for one stable, substitutable subtype contract; stop
   when a module, function, or composed adapter expresses the variation.

## Outcome

Each object has one clearly named owner responsibility, a visible invariant or
lifecycle, explicit collaborators, and no unrelated function-grouping role.

## Failure or stop

Stop and split or redesign the object when it owns unrelated state or
lifecycle concerns, hides an external effect, exists only as a namespace or
one-shot effect wrapper, or uses an ambiguous generic name or inheritance
where composition provides the same substitution boundary.
