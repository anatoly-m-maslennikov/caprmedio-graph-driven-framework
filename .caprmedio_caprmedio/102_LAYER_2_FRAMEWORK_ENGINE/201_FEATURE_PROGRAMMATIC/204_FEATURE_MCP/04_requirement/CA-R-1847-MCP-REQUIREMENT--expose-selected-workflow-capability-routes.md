# Summary

Expose selected Workflow capability routes

## Scope

The Project-local MCP adapter surface for the original thirteen Operator-selected
P1117 capabilities, two explicitly admitted read-only P1520 query Workflows,
and separately admitted Release Version and PUBLIC_RELEASE Workflows.

## Claim

MCP **must** expose only the capability adapters admitted below through the existing reloadable Project-local server, while delegating execution and every-Run recording to the shared `WORKFLOW_OPERATIONS/RUN_SUPPORT` service.

## Details

The admitted route-name set is `create_atom`, `update_atom`, `replace_atom`,
`change_atom_status`, `create_scope_unit`, `rename_scope_unit`,
`move_scope_unit`, `remove_scope_unit`, `run_implementation_workflow`,
`revert_changes`, `build_entities_graph`, `build_terms_graph`,
`build_applicable_methodology`, `find_and_fetch_artifacts`, and
`find_and_fetch_journal_events`, `release_version`, and `public.release`. The current selected-definition binding is the
derived fifteen-route Projection
`.caprmedio_caprmedio/_projection/selected_workflow_bindings.json`. It carries
every route's full current source Workflow, ordered Steps, ordered Action
bindings, and only source-closed native Action calls with exact source path,
Version, and SHA-256 digest. It is an immutable derived projection, not another
Workflow graph or source authority.

The original thirteen entries retain CA-A-1142 v2 as their unchanged selected
source registry and retain its closed source policies. The two query entries
are admitted only by `query_source_admissions` in that same canonical manifest;
that field contains exactly these current acceptance-frontier pins and their
corresponding Workflow/Action/Step pins:

- `find_and_fetch_artifacts`: CA-P-1618@1 at
  `.caprmedio_caprmedio/03_plan/15-CA-P-1117-EPIC--harvest-and-implement-session-derived-operations/08-CA-P-1520-TASK--deliver-read-only-artifact-and-journal-query-workflows/29-CA-P-1618-TASK--accept-current-artifact-query-source-frontier.md`, SHA-256 `bdf10c928c10c102dc489c8e3e526ffe73e8a33d492f4dabc8b5d0129c453b1f`; CA-O-158@4 `d7fdaebdd1d0c6ca7dac9aced25552c487336f2a51f18c0f03ef65d16ff4618a`, CA-O-159@2 `3fd33badbff039e58c1c0b31dfbf3608c37a58d779a1b3ebc14d7bb5ee27dc08`, and CA-O-160@2 `a743a84fd24db32123ac8162e7a2178e6d83b1b727cbe54477b6020914537384` at their accepted P1618 paths.
- `find_and_fetch_journal_events`: CA-P-1535@2 at
  `.caprmedio_caprmedio/03_plan/15-CA-P-1117-EPIC--harvest-and-implement-session-derived-operations/08-CA-P-1520-TASK--deliver-read-only-artifact-and-journal-query-workflows/15-CA-P-1535-TASK--accept-final-journal-query-source.md`, SHA-256 `6246b46d2961d795e29eeb224f01b14979434d4ad24cf3f4913c490268cf52dc`; CA-O-161@2 `362b9d3848a796a14e7374cfa0bf0b561c4f2035b7b2bf87bd9b56fc97a6724d`, CA-O-162@2 `71301ecf9531c70adeba03d6cf7f39761a237a081cee43eb0f9f7ce40e12f9fe`, and CA-O-163@2 `8d0238a1614f5888f2aa486038d271cc58db1d3f0d7014dece0baa53004a489c` at their accepted P1535 paths.

The two acceptance pins are explicit admission evidence, not a second registry,
authority, manifest, parser, or executor. Missing, malformed, incomplete,
duplicate, digest-mismatched, or stale bindings or admissions reject the route
before shared support, worker start, Run creation, Action Run creation, effect,
or Journal event.

`release_version` is not present in the current fifteen-route Projection. It is admitted as an additive sixteenth implementation target only when one successor revision of that same canonical manifest carries D572's complete closed Release source-admission record, including its exact current Workflow, ordered Step/Action occurrences and accepted Release RMED frontier. D572 remains the sole serialization authority for that record. `public.release` is an additive seventeenth implementation target only when that same canonical manifest already carries the exact D572 Release record and also carries CA-D-613's one complete `public_release_source_admissions` record, including its independently completed CA-P-1869 acceptance frontier, O188–O198 occurrences, and public-release RMED frontier. CA-D-613 is the sole serialization authority for the public record. A manifest without `release_version` omits `release_source_admissions`; a manifest without `public.release` omits `public_release_source_admissions`. The original thirteen retain CA-A-1142@2 unchanged; the current two query records and their P1618@1/P1535@2 frontiers remain unchanged. Neither additive source record is a second registry, caller approval, direct Tool binding, or alternate executor; neither can contain itself, a canonical-manifest digest, or any output digest that would form a self-hash cycle. Each mutation-capable `execute` request additionally requires the exact current, route-bound Operator authorization and all D527 proposal/currentness rechecks; missing, stale, malformed, incomplete, duplicate, out-of-order, or digest-mismatched Release or PUBLIC_RELEASE evidence rejects before a Run, queue intent, effect, or Journal event.

Every route delegates one normalized CA-D-527 v3 request to shared
`run_selected_operation(request)`: request/route identity, typed
input/parameters, target-frontier and effects digests, caller-chosen
idempotency/retry key, optional real parent lineage, explicit current sealed
Initiative authorization for mutations, and exactly one outer
`definition_manifest` (`manifest_ref`, `manifest_digest`). That outer object is
the sole canonical manifest binding. `source_freshness` carries only current
selected-source registry/binding evidence; `definition_manifest_ref`,
`definition_manifest_digest`, or any other manifest ref/digest supplied there
or elsewhere are unknown shadow fields and are rejected, including if their
digest differs. It returns only the shared `RunResult`: real Run/definition IDs,
outcome, safe result/effect/report/output refs, canonical Journal recording
state/event refs, source currentness, and diagnostics. `mode` defaults to
`preview`; preview creates no Run, Action Run, Event, mutation authority, or
Journal write. Only explicit `execute` may start work. A mutation-capable route
also requires its exact current Operator authorization. An admitted read-only
query may execute only with its exact current query-source admission, canonical
manifest, and explicit `execute` request; it gains no mutation authority. Its
actual Run/Action Run recording remains shared support's responsibility. No
`apply` mode exists.

Before shared support admits `find_and_fetch_journal_events`, the adapter must
capture and bind CA-O-163's sealed canonical Journal byte-prefix snapshot. The
actual Workflow/Action Run records are appended only after that capture and
cannot enter, enlarge, or replay the query result. Both query routes reuse the
one CA-R-1850 closed literal grammar and never accept SQL, code, arbitrary
expressions, secrets, or a second parser.

`get_selected_workflow_run` and `get_selected_action_run` read only one exact Run/Action Run and return its status, safe output/result/effect references, lineage, source currentness, and canonical event/receipt references. `recover_selected_run_recording` accepts only a pending shared-recording event reference and retries persistence with the same event identity and payload; it never replays an Action or Workflow. MCP must not implement a parallel request schema or execution path.

The adapters reuse the server's existing Project-root/stdin binding, discovery helpers, `workflow_orchestrator`, and hot-reload gateway. CA-D-521 v7's existing DBOS `enqueue_selected` variant remains the general selected-dispatch variant; MCP supplies the admitted request to that existing APP and does not create another executor. The adapters add no alternate root, shell, arbitrary path, generic mutation, implicit dispatch, Journal writer, or duplicate business behavior. The existing eight helper names and their contracts remain available. Route annotations truthfully describe preview/execute behavior and do not override client permission policy.
