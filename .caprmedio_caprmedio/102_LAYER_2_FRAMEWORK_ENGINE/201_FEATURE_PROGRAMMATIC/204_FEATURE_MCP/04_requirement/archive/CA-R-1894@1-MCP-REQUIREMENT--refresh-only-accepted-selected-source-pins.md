# Summary

Refresh only accepted selected source pins

## Scope

the exact admitted selected-source revision refresh under the current Epic.

## Claim

the selected binding Projection **must** support an explicitly authorized refresh of the exact source revision registered by CA-D-588-MCP-DELIVERY--register-the-prepared-successor-binding-refresh, while preserving its admitted capability identities and graph.

## Details

- the registered source revision is authority; the refreshed binding is derived evidence, not new authority.
- preserve **all** route identities, order, Steps, Actions, native calls, edges, query admissions and registry identity. **only** the registered version and digest occurrences and resulting derived digests change.
- retain exact current Operator authorization, source-currentness checks, publication intent, readback and Journal completion. a pending recording is not completed publication.
- unknown revisions, changes to topology or capability admission remain outside this refresh.
