# Summary

Preserve existing MCP helpers and hot reload

## Scope

Compatibility of selected MCP adapters with the stable gateway and existing helper surface.

## Claim

Selected adapters **must** be additive and reload-compatible; they **must not** replace the stable gateway, its root binding, or its eight existing helpers.

## Details

Implementation registers the declared routes through `create_server(root)` after
root resolution and uses the current stdio transport and stable hot-reload
boundary. It preserves `discover_tools`, `discover_operations`,
`get_execution_context`, `get_execution_status`, `resume_execution_context`,
`watch_execution`, `rmed_atoms_base_revise`, and `workflow_orchestrator` with
their current names and contracts. `workflow_orchestrator` remains the general
selected-queue entrypoint for an admitted `enqueue_selected` request; it does
not itself become a per-route executor. Only a selected route whose configured
execution binding is absent is blocked or deferred. That absence does not
disallow an otherwise accepted general selected-queue request, including either
admitted read-only query route once its exact binding is implemented.

Reload validates a complete new route registry before publication, keeps in-flight calls on their captured implementation generation, and rolls back invalid registration without removing prior helpers. The selected route registry exposes only current/admitted source bindings supplied by the adapter/service; stale or unsupported routes remain rejected or explicitly deferred. MCP code contains adapter/validation/projection logic only; the common `RUN_SUPPORT` interface owns lifecycle execution, durable event retries, and canonical Journal persistence.
