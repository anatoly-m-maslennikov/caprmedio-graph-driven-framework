# Summary

Record obsolete status-route golden inputs

## Concern

Two existing MCP fixtures still submit route_input for Change Atom Status while current admitted lifecycle input requires actual target and status. P1692's combined twenty-seven development tests failed these two old cases; its seven new loader and eight source-admission tests passed. P1695 repairs only actual fixture inputs and preserves current source/status/preview guards; no production bypass or weakened assertion is admitted.

## Evidences

test_every_selected_route_forwards_one_mutation_free_preview patches the loader before its obsolete status request. test_current_physical_manifest_freezes_original_thirteen_through_queue fails carrier-fields-invalid from unchanged APP preflight. The production manifest remains unchanged.

## Blast radius

MCP regression evidence for the already updated status route, not a new capability or actual queue/image proof.

## Resolution

P1695 corrects the disposable inputs without production changes or weakened assertions. Root ran all twelve MCP fixture tests in the permitted development worker, including both previously failing cases; all pass. Actual queue-process/image proof remains separate.
