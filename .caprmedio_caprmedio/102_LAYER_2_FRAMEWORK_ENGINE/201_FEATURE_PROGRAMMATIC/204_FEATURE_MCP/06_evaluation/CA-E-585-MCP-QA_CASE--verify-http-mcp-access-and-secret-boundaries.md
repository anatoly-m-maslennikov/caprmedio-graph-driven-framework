# Summary

verify HTTP MCP access and secret boundaries

## Scope

the additional localhost HTTP transport for the existing Project MCP Gateway.

## Claim

the Evaluation **must** verify that HTTP access failures occur before MCP handling and preserve the existing permission and secret boundaries.

## Details

1. include good Requests with absent, valid-looking, and arbitrary Authorization values, hostile Host/Origin cases, absent Origin, and Session continuations.
2. verify Host/Origin rejection and no Tool invocation or reload receipt on rejected Requests; Authorization values do not grant, deny, or otherwise alter admitted localhost access.
3. verify readiness requires the loopback Host/Origin and MCP initialization boundary, not password, bearer, Token, credential configuration, or rotation.
4. check localhost-only Compose mapping, no Docker socket, no HTTP credential configuration, no secret-bearing command arguments or logs, and unchanged stdio/default worker startup.
