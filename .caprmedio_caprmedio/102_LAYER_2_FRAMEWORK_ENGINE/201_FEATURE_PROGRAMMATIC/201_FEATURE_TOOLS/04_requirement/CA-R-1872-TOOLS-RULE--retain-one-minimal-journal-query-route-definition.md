# Summary

Retain one minimal Journal query route definition

## Scope

The source-to-implementation route.

## Claim

FIND_AND_FETCH_JOURNAL_EVENTS **must** retain exactly one Workflow, one query Action, and one query Step as its source route.

## Details

Shared Run support remains shared infrastructure and does not become an additional Workflow or query Action.
