# Summary

Journal only an actual query Run through shared support

## Scope

Actual query invocation evidence.

## Claim

To record an actual Journal query invocation, the Tool **must** delegate
preview/execute admission and Run evidence to shared selected-Run support only
after the adapter captured the sealed frontier; that evidence consumes no Event
in the frontier.

## Details

Preview has no Run/Event; execute records only actual Run outcomes and cannot change the already captured result frontier.
