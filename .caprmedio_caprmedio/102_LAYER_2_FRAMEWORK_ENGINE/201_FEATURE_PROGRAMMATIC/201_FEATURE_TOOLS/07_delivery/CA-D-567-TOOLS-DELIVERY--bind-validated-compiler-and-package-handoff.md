# Summary

Bind validated compiler and package handoff

## Scope

The internal trusted handoff from a validated sealed candidate and successful compiler output to future package staging.

## Claim

Release Version **must** admit package staging only from one typed internal handoff, constructed from locally observed current selections, authority bytes, source inventory, and successful compiler output after the D566 manifest checksum and every sealed binding validate. Current reusable schema-1 packages use `SealedPortableCandidateCompilation`; retained legacy/recovery packages use `SealedCandidateCompilation`. Neither path trusts caller-provided gates, raw authority mappings, package rows, source permissions, or success evidence.

The completed `SealedSourceCopy` handoff is also the predecessor-only source-copy proof when a later phase fails, blocks, or remains unpromoted. Its fixed source-copy target is exactly `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`; the proof must bind the old frozen candidate manifest, expected and actual old copy SHA-256 values, the same executing N, and a complete old-tree inventory of safe fixed-path files, bytes/SHA-256 values, and modes. The proof is usable only after the canonical Journal record and the exact Action/Run and CA-D-574 sealed checkpoint/proof are authenticated; arbitrary retained JSON, a missing/unrecorded proof, unknown member, tampered bytes, unsafe path, mode drift, or identity/wrong-N mismatch is a strict block. This predecessor proof does not authorize a new candidate, reuse old output, or replay old authorization. A new candidate independently revalidates its current source/settings/frontier/authority and performs the normal fresh copy, requiring its new actual copy SHA-256 to equal its new expected value; old and new source/frontier/settings digests are not required to match.

## Details

### Current reusable package handoff

`SealedPortableCandidateCompilation` has exactly these fields:

- `candidate_run_id`: the same single safe run component named by the private sealed export.
- `candidate`: the physically revalidated D566 candidate and locally derived authority.
- `private_compilation`: the reopened `SealedPrivateMethodologyCompilation`, binding the frozen export, inventory and export-seal digests through its compiled manifest, exact compiled output and candidate identity.
- `portable_package_rows`: destination-ordered observed rows with `resource`, `source_path`, `destination_path`, `sha256` and `mode`.
- `source_catalog_sha256`: the exact locally read root `catalog.toml` bytes.
- `input_manifest_sha256`: the canonical JSON checksum binding this run, candidate, canonical Version value/bytes, private compiled manifest/output, source catalog and all portable rows.

The portable rows cover the whole `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE` tree, locked root dependencies, root `version.toml`, root `catalog.toml`, its referenced admission proofs, admitted defaults, the canonical ca payload projected to `SKILLS/ca`, and only sealed selected active Methodology Atoms and declared support projected to their D596 package paths. Admission proof rows use `resource = "SOURCE_ADMISSION"` and retain `admissions/<receipt_sha256>.json` as their source and destination. A shared proof appears once. The intentional ca projection may reuse source bytes, but destination paths remain unique. Every source digest and mode is locally observed; catalog source paths and digests must match the planned package rows. The proof bytes and their exact descriptor matches are reopened under D602. A missing catalog, missing or malformed proof, changed input or unsealed private compilation blocks the handoff rather than creating an admission receipt or reconstructing absent authority.

`collect_portable_source_snapshot` provides a typed, read-only `SealedPortableSourceSnapshot` with the same run, candidate and private-compilation binding and the observed package rows before catalog or admission proofs exist. `revalidate_portable_source_snapshot` repeats those observations. This snapshot is input to the separately commanded source-admission Action; it is not approval, a catalog, a package staging handoff or a test result.

`build_sealed_portable_compilation` observes this handoff without assembling a package. `revalidate_sealed_portable_compilation` repeats the physical observations and requires exact equality before the package producer copies those bytes. The producer stages only a private D597 candidate package; this handoff grants no test pass, image selection, live installation or promotion.

### Retained legacy and recovery handoff

`SealedAuthority` is internal context, never a request member. It contains the locally read executing release selection, candidate release identity, canonical source snapshot digest, Project Structure digest, Framework Settings digest, source-frontier digest, nested-source recursive digest, and expected D566 manifest SHA-256. Currentness is established by those local facts and exact comparisons, not by caller assertion or refresh-in-place.

Before compiler or package staging, the internal handoff records the safe derived source-copy root and `actual_derived_source_copy_sha256` from the complete delivered copy, then requires equality with D566's `expected_derived_source_copy_sha256`; a missing, partial, mismatched, stale, or uncertain copy blocks both stages. After a successful compiler invocation, `SealedCandidateCompilation` contains exactly the validated `candidate_snapshot_manifest_sha256`, the `SealedAuthority` binding, source-copy root, expected and actual derived-source-copy SHA-256 values, compiler entrypoint identity, compiler frontier digest, `expected_compiled_output_sha256`, `actual_compiled_output_sha256`, child materialization root, and destination-ordered `package_rows`. `actual_compiled_output_sha256` is captured from the compiler's materialized bytes only after that effect succeeds and must equal the manifest expectation; its absence, mismatch, compiler failure, stale local input, or uncertain result blocks staging. It is not required, inferred, or prefilled by the candidate manifest.

Each derived `package_row` has `resource`, safe repository-relative `source_path`, safe package-relative `destination_path`, actual `sha256` from the locally read source bytes, and `mode` from that source file's observed `stat().st_mode & 0o777`. The package adapter re-reads each source immediately before copy and requires both digest and observed mode to match the handoff; it never accepts a caller permission override. The rows must cover the complete D562 Framework package and D563 `ca` payload, remain uniquely destination-bound, and preserve N while staging retained N+1.

The handoff is an internal validation boundary, not a claim of compiler, package, installation, image, promotion, retirement, or Journal success. It preserves D561's canonical authority and nested source subtree byte-for-byte: source-to-derived copy never becomes an authority switch, source-ancestor replacement, or permitted mutation.

### Private predecessor-retention carriers

Prospective source-copy replacement reserves a private sibling directory under the fixed source-copy target's parent, with basename `.release-sources-prior-<internally generated suffix>`. The absent `sources` child inside that reservation carries the complete authenticated predecessor after its atomic move. Preserve the wrapper even when empty; it is a reservation, not a completed predecessor. Existing flat historical backup carriers remain retained unchanged. Failure recovery references include every existing reserved wrapper, predecessor child, candidate staging and fixed target. The fixed public `source_copy_root`, source-copy handoff, N13 registration, inventory codec and Journal schemas remain unchanged. These private carriers grant no replay or success authority.

### Current predecessor trust registrations

Under the existing CA-P-1117 autonomy envelope, Release Version may admit historical source-delivery evidence prospectively through this source-authoritative private carrier. It is a current admission, not retroactive sealing and not proof that mutable bytes were unchanged at the historical run time. The following fenced object is the one locally verified N13 registration, retained as current evidence:

The current reader accepts only an object with exactly `schema_version` and `registrations`, exact integer `schema_version = 1`, and exactly one applicable record with no missing or unknown member. The record keys are exactly `registration_id`, `basis`, `authorization_ref`, `registered_at`, `journal_path`, `event_id`, `event_digest`, `effect_ref`, `action_result_path`, `action_result_sha256`, `checkpoint_path`, `checkpoint_sha256`, `candidate_snapshot_manifest_sha256`, `executing_release`, `source_copy_root`, `expected_derived_source_copy_sha256`, `actual_derived_source_copy_sha256`, and `persistent_inventory_sha256`. `basis` must equal `current admission of historical delivery evidence`; all referenced paths must be safe, the executing release must equal current N, and `source_copy_root` must be exactly `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`. Every pinned byte/value is re-read and must have exactly one current authoritative match across the authorization, Journal event, Action result, CA-D-574 checkpoint, candidate manifest, occupied source-copy tree, and inventory; lowercase 64-hex digests and current modes are required. Malformed, unknown, duplicate, ambiguous, tampered, wrong-N, stale, or unsafe records are refused.

`persistent_inventory_sha256` is the SHA-256 of canonical UTF-8 bytes from `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True, separators=(',', ':'), ensure_ascii=False).encode('utf-8')` with no newline, using exactly `{"directories":[{"path":...,"mode":...}],"files":[{"path":...,"mode":...,"sha256":...}]}`; both arrays are sorted by path, every decimal `mode` is `stat().st_mode & 0o777`, directories include `.` and every non-transient directory including empty directories, and the shared Release inventory exclusions apply while symlinks and special entries are refused. The current inventory must revalidate the registered expected and actual source-copy values; otherwise the registration is blocked. This registration only permits retaining or replacing exactly the occupied predecessor copy during a new candidate's independent current sealing and normal fresh delivery. It never authorizes reuse, replay, or promotion of old output or authorization, and it adds no public request, route, graph, or Journal schema member.
