# Summary

Find Tools by capability

## Scope

the DISCOVER_TOOLS capability for Tool/DISCOVER_TOOLS.

## Claim

the DISCOVER_TOOLS Tool **must** return a ranked, bounded selection of Tools matching the requested capability and filters, with exact source references and observed availability.

## Details

- implement the methodology Action CA-O-112-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-ACTION--find-tools-by-capability.
- accept a query, Scope Unit and availability filters, offset, and result limit; return compact matches, total matches, next offset, catalog fingerprint, and coverage diagnostics.
- preserve the Operator's choice of what **to** execute; discovery, context retrieval, **and** observation provide capabilities.
- bounded **or** unavailable evidence **must** remain explicit **rather than** establish a successful assessment.
