# Summary

Encode WATCH_EXECUTION Tool binding

## Scope

the WATCH_EXECUTION capability for Tool/WATCH_EXECUTION/Carrier.

## Claim

the WATCH_EXECUTION Tool binding **must** be carried **in** the following TOML table **in** this Atom's Details, with JSON request **and** response Carriers.

## Details

accept a supported Run ID, opaque cursor and bounded wait timeout; return a new cursor, updates, current status, timeout state, and full report reference.

```toml
[tool_binding]
name = "WATCH_EXECUTION"
entrypoint = "102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/201_TOOLS/WATCH_EXECUTION/watch_execution.py"
action_ids = ["CA-O-117"]
mcp_name = "watch_execution"
```

- the MCP boundary exposes the Implementation's strict input schema. unknown fields **and** invalid selectors are explicit errors.
- return repository-relative source paths **and** SHA-256 bindings. full content is loaded **only** **when** requested.
- observation cursors bind the Run ID, saved Event frontier **and** saved status fingerprint; a cursor from another Run is invalid.
