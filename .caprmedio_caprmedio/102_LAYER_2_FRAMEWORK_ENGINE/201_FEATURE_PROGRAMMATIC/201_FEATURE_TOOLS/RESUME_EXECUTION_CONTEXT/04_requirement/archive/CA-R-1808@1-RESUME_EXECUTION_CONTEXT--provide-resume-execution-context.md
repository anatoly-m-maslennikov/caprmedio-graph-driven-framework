# Summary

Load the remaining execution work

## Scope

the RESUME_EXECUTION_CONTEXT capability for Tool/RESUME_EXECUTION_CONTEXT.

## Claim

the RESUME_EXECUTION_CONTEXT Tool **must** return sufficient saved context to continue unfinished work under the same Run ID without replaying completed effects.

## Details

- implement the methodology Action CA-O-116-PROJECT_CONFIGURATION-ACTION--resume-execution-context.
- accept a supported Run ID; return original request, frozen selection and criteria bindings, pending check or fix work, saved handoffs, current-source observations, and recording blockers.
- preserve the Operator's choice of what **to** execute; discovery, context retrieval, **and** observation provide capabilities.
- bounded **or** unavailable evidence **must** remain explicit **rather than** establish a successful assessment.
