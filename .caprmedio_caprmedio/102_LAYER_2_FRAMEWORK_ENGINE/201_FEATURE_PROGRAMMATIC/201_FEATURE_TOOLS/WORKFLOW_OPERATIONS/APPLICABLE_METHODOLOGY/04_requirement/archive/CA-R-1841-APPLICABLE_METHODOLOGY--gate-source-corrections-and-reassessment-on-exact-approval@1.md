# Summary

Gate source correction and conflict-selection dispositions on exact canonical-Journal approval, then reassess.

## Scope

The CA-O-154 through CA-O-156 decision and correction boundary; source mutation remains outside the compiler.

## Claim

`COMPILE_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY` **must not** edit methodology authority and **must** accept a conflict selection or correction result only with exact current Operator, source, and Journal provenance, followed by reselection and reassessment.

## Details

For a decision, the Tool requires the exact conflict ID, proposal or candidate selection, source-frontier digest, Operator identity, canonical Journal decision reference, and receipt evidence that the decision is current and unambiguous. A stale, partial, missing, mismatched, rejected, ambiguous, or revoked decision is `blocked`. A Project Configuration approval file may be a non-authoritative lookup index only when it resolves to that exact canonical Journal decision; it cannot independently authorize selection or correction.

When the accepted disposition requires source correction, the Tool returns the source-owner correction request and awaits an independently produced owned-source change receipt. It has no `edit_source` or projected-Claim-fix mode. No compiler-side effect, output change, approval cache, or inferred delegation may alter source authority. A successful external source change, a non-mutating selection decision, a failed correction, or a recovery attempt requires a fresh CA-R-1839 selection and CA-R-1840 assessment before publication. Failed or partial correction preserves the prior projection and reports actual known effects; it never resumes from the former assessment.

The Tool returns `{ outcome: "reassess_required" | "blocked", decision_provenance, correction_request_or_receipt, evidence_refs }`. It does not create a duplicate approval Atom or duplicate shared Run-support behavior.
