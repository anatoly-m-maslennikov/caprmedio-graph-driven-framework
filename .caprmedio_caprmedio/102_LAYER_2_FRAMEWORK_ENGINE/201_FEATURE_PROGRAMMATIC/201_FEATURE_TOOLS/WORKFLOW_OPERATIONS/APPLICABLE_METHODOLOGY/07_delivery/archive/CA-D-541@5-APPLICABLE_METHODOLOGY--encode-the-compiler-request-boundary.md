# Summary

Encode the strict governed request boundary for the Applicable Methodology compiler.

## Scope

The strict native request boundary for the Applicable Methodology compiler; it does not define a second Workflow or Journal interface.

## Claim

The delivered compiler **must** accept an explicit mode and exact governed bindings, and **must not** accept caller-supplied source edits, arbitrary conflict winners, or unbound approval text.

## Details

```toml
[tool_binding]
name = "COMPILE_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY"
entrypoint = "102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/201_TOOLS/COMPILE_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/compile_applicable_methodology.py"
workflow_id = "CA-O-011"
action_ids = ["CA-O-004", "CA-O-005", "CA-O-006", "CA-O-007", "CA-O-008", "CA-O-009"]
operations = ["dry_run", "apply", "recover_publication"]
```

The strict request contains `operation`; `project_root`; expected Project Structure, Framework Settings, and Project Configuration revision/digest bindings; `projection_target`; and, for `apply` or `recover_publication`, the expected assessed frontier digest plus the exact current Operator decision, independently verified admitted Run/effect evidence, and prior-publication evidence references. Optional Journal references are observational and cannot authorize the operation. The Tool resolves all source locations from governed Project Structure/Settings. `apply` refuses a request without a fresh publishable assessment; `recover_publication` accepts only a failed-publication receipt and never a source-change instruction.

Unknown fields, mixed operations, mutable source/output paths outside governed declarations, `edit_source`, raw source patch, arbitrary selected candidate, raw approval text, or a TOML-only approval are explicit errors. Canonical shared Run/Journal handles are references, not caller-authored event payloads; a Journal append is a business-provenance attempt and not a permission or completion gate.
