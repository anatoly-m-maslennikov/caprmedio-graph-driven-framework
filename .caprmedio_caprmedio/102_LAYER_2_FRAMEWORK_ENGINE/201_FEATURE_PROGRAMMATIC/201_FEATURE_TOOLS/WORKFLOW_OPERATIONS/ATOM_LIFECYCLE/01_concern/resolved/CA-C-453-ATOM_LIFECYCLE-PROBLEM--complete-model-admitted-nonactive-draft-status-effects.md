# Summary

Complete model-admitted nonactive Draft status effects

## Concern

The source-derived Status model admits Analysis Done→Draft, but the native effect refuses it at the active-only history guard. Universal Status handling is incomplete despite the fourteen passing initial golden tests.

## Evidences

Root invoked the saved native real-source fixture in the existing development worker with Analysis Done→Draft. The request resolved its actual current model, then failed LifecycleError atom-not-active in preserve_atom_revision; the Project snapshot remained unchanged. Saved native hashes were lifecycle_intents.py15d15e7afabf2abc0d46fdb4e68fa5ecf8e78f6ccc765fcd8c60cb5c13c79c99 and atom_operations.py2a5532d89e6a5a8957b10a80814e07117ce6debf8bbc0af2ba8b2bd52b046519. The same code checks only literal Draft, while Concern uses lowercase draft, and its draft-basename expression recognizes only the short fixture form without Scope/Type/Tier components.

## Blast radius

Model-admitted Draft demotion for non-Active and lowercase-role carriers and canonical full filenames. CA-P-1664 owns bounded test-first repair. Existing passing native tests remain evidence for their exact cases, not all Status pairs or shared/MCP/image completion.

## Resolution

CA-P-1664 repairs the exact native defects: non-Active identified carriers and lowercase Concern draft can demote; full filenames lose only their assigned number; immutable Archived carriers are not current. Four focused demotion tests and fourteen native model-driven tests pass in the existing development worker. The root separately reran the four-test corpus. Draft promotion remains a different CA-P-1662/P1670 issue and is not claimed fixed by this Concern.
