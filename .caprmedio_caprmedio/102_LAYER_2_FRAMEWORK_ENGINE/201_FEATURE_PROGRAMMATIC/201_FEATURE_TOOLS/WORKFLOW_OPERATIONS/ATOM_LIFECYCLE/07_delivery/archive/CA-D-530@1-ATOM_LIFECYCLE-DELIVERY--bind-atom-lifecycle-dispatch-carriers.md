# Summary

Bind Atom lifecycle dispatch carriers

## Scope

The authority-relative `WORKFLOW_OPERATIONS/ATOM_LIFECYCLE` RMED packet.

## Claim

The packet delivers its Requirements in `04_requirement`, golden QA Cases in `06_evaluation`, and delivery contracts in `07_delivery`; it composes existing native lifecycle Tool Carriers rather than replacing them.

## Details

`ATOM_LIFECYCLE` is a bounded authority path below registered `TOOLS`, not a declared Scope Unit.
