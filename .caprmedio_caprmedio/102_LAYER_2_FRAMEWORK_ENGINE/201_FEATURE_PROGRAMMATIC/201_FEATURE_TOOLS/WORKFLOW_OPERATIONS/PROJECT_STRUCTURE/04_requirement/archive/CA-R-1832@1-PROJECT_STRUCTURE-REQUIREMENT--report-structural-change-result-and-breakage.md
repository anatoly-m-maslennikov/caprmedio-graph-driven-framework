# Summary

Report structural change result and breakage

## Scope

The result boundary after CA-O-143 cutover and CA-O-144 assessment.

## Claim

The Tool **must** return exact outcome, current declaration revision, actual effects, and complete preservation/breakage disposition without representing a source definition or preview as an executed change.

## Details

- Output includes operation, requested and resulting Scope Unit identity/parent/paths, pre/post TOML revisions, authorization revision, affected and repaired references, preserved Carriers, explicit breakages, validation evidence, recovery disposition, and available Workflow/Action Run and Journal references.
- `completed` is returned only after required assessment checks accept actual effects. `rolled_back` identifies the restored set and any remaining breakage. `partial` and all blocked outcomes remain terminally truthful and machine-readable.
- The result must distinguish absent evidence, failed evidence recording, and a failed structural operation; it must not manufacture a successful no-op, rollback, or journal receipt.
