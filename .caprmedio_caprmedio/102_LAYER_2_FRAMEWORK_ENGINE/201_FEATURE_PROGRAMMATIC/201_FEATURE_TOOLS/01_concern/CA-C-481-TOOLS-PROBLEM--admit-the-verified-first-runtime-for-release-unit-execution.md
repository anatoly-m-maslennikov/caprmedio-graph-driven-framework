# Summary

Admit the verified first runtime for Release Unit execution

## Concern

The actual N-to-N+1 Release Run stops at installed-N Unit admission with `release-suite-executor-n-unproven`, although the initial runtime package, immutable image and canonical installation proof have independently passed. The suite executor needs an authenticated first-N proof path consistent with the admitted initialization boundary.

## Evidences

- Run `release-first-cut-20261006-N1` completed source freeze, binding validation, complete Methodology source delivery and candidate compilation. Candidate snapshot: `7c03cf2fb1e74578099eaf0b0ac753a6c46b88a3ea8a57ddc638f1394647dc7b`.
- Actual O185/O168 progress: `.caprmedio_install/workflow_orchestrator/runs/release-first-cut-20261006-N1/release-first-cut-20261006-N1:step:5:action:1.json`. Native outcome is blocked, reason `phase stopped: release-suite-executor-n-unproven`; canonical Action, Step and Workflow terminal outcomes are `interrupted_pending`.
- Selected initial N/package SHA: `6f2e3a615a4f4d6da0f16831800f9e4b7ff84f89b89faeefc359f51711d28c57`. Immutable image: `sha256:79899cfe59fb36c8da5ce1c12ea52c529a61738e51100b3d3e8488c52496d54e`. The real bootstrap canary verified all 15,135 package files and 28 MCP Tools; all build/inspect/canary commands exited 0 without timeout.
- Independent first-N acceptance verified package bytes/modes/pathset, exact selector, hook-free public Skill, retained proof and a fresh Docker inspection, plus sealed O180 started/completed Journal events and persisted receipts. Completed event digest: `203fa0be69330ec6531738e2749b11b66e60577b11022e5409361431cf4632f1`.

## Blast radius

No Unit tests, candidate image/E2E, Full Gate or promotion occurred in this Run. Installed N, its selector, Skill and image remain the verified working baseline. Earlier completed source-delivery/compilation effects and canonical interruption evidence are retained; the blocked Run is not replayed.

## Disposition

Repair only the existing suite executor's authenticated first-N proof integration. Preserve exact immutable package/image bindings, source-mapped driver integrity, authentic retained command/canary proof and fresh Docker inspection, without requiring changed N+1 host sources to equal historical N. Preserve the existing genuine Release-image path and refuse forged/mismatched proof. Use a fresh sealed candidate/Run after the bounded repair; do not weaken the gate, mutate installed N or fabricate prior Release evidence. Broad all-sixteen audit, HTTP MCP, extra recovery expansion and automatic prior-image retirement remain deferred for the first-release cut.
