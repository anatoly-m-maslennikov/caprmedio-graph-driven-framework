# Summary

Verify structural reference coverage

## Concern

Structural change accepts an arbitrary empty reference frontier and caller Goal/preservation assertions without complete affected-carrier coverage.

## Evidences

At commit `c011b68fa`, `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/201_TOOLS/WORKFLOW_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_STRUCTURE/project_structure.py:327-409` accepts empty reference frontiers and asserted Goal state; apply accounts only those supplied references. CA-O-012 and CA-O-014 require complete prepared/current affected coverage.

Source/mock results do not establish actual release completion.

## Blast radius

The restored audit additionally found resulting-tree validation delayed until apply, caller-asserted Goal/Carrier coverage, absent Move reparenting coverage and secret-content recovery serialization. CA-P-1776 owns these bounded repairs against O012/O005/O014. Existing narrower reference-repair evidence does not close those new findings.

The affected selected Workflow, full release gate and CA-P-1655 final acceptance.

## Disposition

Resolve actual declared references and Goal state before mutation; do not force Goal existence. Block incomplete coverage rather than silently leaving broken references.

CA-P-1759 owns the bounded repair. Keep this Problem active until its regression and independent acceptance establish the repair.

## Resolution

CA-P-1776 closes the additional admission gaps. Twenty-two focused Project Structure tests pass; an independent read-only review accepts current candidate validation, observed Goal/Carrier evidence, Move reference/parent coverage and secret refusal before recovery serialization. This resolves the source defect; actual selected Workflow execution and final release acceptance remain separately required.
