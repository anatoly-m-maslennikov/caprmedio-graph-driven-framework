# Summary

Guard source freshness at publication

## Concern

The compiler's staging check precedes live output replacement; changed sources can be detected only after the replacement.

## Evidences

At commit `c011b68fa`, `102_FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/201_PROGRAMMATIC/201_TOOLS/COMPILE_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/compile_applicable_methodology.py:1202-1204` replaces before its final freshness check. Regression: `COMPILE_APPLICABLE_METHODOLOGY/tests/test_selected_compilation.py`; CA-O-009 supplies the publication boundary.

Source/mock results do not establish actual release completion.

## Blast radius

The affected selected Workflow, full release gate and CA-P-1655 final acceptance.

## Disposition

Revalidate at the publication boundary and prove a detected pre-publication change leaves output unchanged. Report any actual post-effect state truthfully.

CA-P-1761 owns the bounded repair. Keep this Problem active until its regression and independent acceptance establish the repair.
