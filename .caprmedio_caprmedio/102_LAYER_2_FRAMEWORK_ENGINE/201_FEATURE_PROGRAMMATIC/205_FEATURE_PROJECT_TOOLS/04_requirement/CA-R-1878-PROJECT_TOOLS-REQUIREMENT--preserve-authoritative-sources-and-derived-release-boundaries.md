# Summary

Preserve authoritative sources across release delivery

## Scope

The boundary between canonical release inputs and derived source, runtime, Skill, and image deliveries.

## Claim

Release Version **must** copy, compile, package, install, and verify only derived deliveries while preserving canonical authoring sources, Project Structure, Project and Framework Settings, existing Journal evidence, and unrelated Skills byte-for-byte.

## Details

Neither a compiled Methodology projection nor an installed package establishes source authority. A source/frontier change after sealing invalidates promotion and requires a fresh candidate; it does not permit repair through the release Tool.

When the normal source-copy phase has completed and a later phase fails, blocks, or becomes recording-uncertain, Release Version **must** retain the completed source-copy predecessor proof even when the candidate is never promoted. The proof authenticates the old frozen candidate manifest, expected and actual old source-copy SHA-256 values, the same executing N, the fixed target `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`, the complete old-tree file bytes and modes, and the canonical Journal plus Action/Run and sealed CA-D-574 checkpoint/proof references. Unknown, tampered, unrecorded, unsafe, mode-drifted, identity-drifted, or wrong-N predecessor evidence is blocked; file presence or arbitrary old JSON is not proof. The old proof is predecessor ownership evidence only: it neither authorizes a new candidate nor requires old source, settings, or frontier digests to equal a new candidate's independently sealed values.

Under the existing CA-P-1117 autonomy envelope, a prospective current admission may register historical source-delivery evidence only through the bounded source-authoritative registration defined by CA-D-567. This is not retroactive sealing and does not prove that mutable bytes were unchanged at the historical run time. The closed registration has `schema_version: 1`, exactly one applicable record with `basis` equal to `current admission of historical delivery evidence`, and exactly the CA-D-567 fields. A current reader must re-read every referenced Journal, Action/Run, checkpoint, candidate manifest, executing-N identity, fixed source-copy root, expected/actual copy digest, and persistent inventory; every pinned byte/value must have exactly one current authoritative match. Malformed, unknown, ambiguous, tampered, wrong-N, unsafe, or inventory-mismatched evidence is refused. The complete mode-aware persistent-inventory definition and serialization authority is CA-D-567; R1878 requires its current admission to yield a truthful preservation/admission outcome for the exact occupied predecessor copy. The registration can only retain or replace that exact copy during a fresh independently sealed delivery; it cannot reuse, replay, or promote old output or authorization.
