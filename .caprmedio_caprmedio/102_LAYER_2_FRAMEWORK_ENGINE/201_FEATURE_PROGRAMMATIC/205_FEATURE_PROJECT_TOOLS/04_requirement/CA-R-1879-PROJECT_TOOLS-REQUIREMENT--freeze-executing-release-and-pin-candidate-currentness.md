# Summary

Freeze the executing release and pin candidate currentness

## Scope

The N-to-N+1 boundary during candidate construction, testing, installation, and rollback.

## Claim

Release Version **must** keep the executing Framework, active runtime pointer, and project-local `ca` Skill at frozen N while constructing and testing a separately pinned N+1; the full suite must pass before separately staging/installing N+1, and promotion may select N+1 only after installed-package and actual candidate-image gates also pass.

## Details

Candidate N+1 may be retained separately after its suite gate, but N remains the runnable rollback point and active public selection until promotion. The executing Run never silently substitutes candidate definitions, and first-cut verification never invokes another release. Changed N, candidate inputs, output digest, test environment, or image identity blocks the affected promotion rather than being refreshed in place.
