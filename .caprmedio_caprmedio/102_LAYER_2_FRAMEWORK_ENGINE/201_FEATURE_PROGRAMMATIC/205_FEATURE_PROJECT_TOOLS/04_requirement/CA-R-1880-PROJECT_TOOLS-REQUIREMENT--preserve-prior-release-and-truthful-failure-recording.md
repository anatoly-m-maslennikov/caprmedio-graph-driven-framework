# Summary

Preserve the prior release and truthful failure recording

## Scope

Release failure, recording uncertainty, rollback, and delayed old-image retirement.

## Claim

On a failed, blocked, or uncertain release effect or recording, Release Version **must** preserve the prior selected N and actual effect evidence, report the shared Run/Action result truthfully, and never replay an uncertain effect; it may retire an exact old image only after successful N+1 verification and proof that no container or required rollback reference retains it.

## Details

Rollback restores only the retained prior selection and affected derived carriers. A request, dry run, candidate manifest, or queued Run is not success, and no failure path authorizes source mutation or broad image pruning.
