# Summary

Seal the Release Version request and candidate boundary

## Scope

One requested release promotion from executing Version N to separately pinned candidate Version N+1 through one candidateSnapshotManifest.

## Claim

The Release Version Tool **must** accept only one sealed Operator-selected `candidateSnapshotManifest` that identifies executing N, candidate N+1, exact source revisions and digests, Project Structure and Framework Settings bindings, expected compiler frontier, complete package rows, declared full-suite environment, Skill target, and candidate image reference.

## Details

The Tool rejects absent, ambiguous, changed, caller-substituted, or unsealed manifest bindings before any effect. The manifest may reference canonical authority through its sealed source snapshot; it does not rewrite or replace that authority. A request does not authorize a source edit, a definition switch during an executing Run, an unbounded image deletion, or a recursive release invocation.
