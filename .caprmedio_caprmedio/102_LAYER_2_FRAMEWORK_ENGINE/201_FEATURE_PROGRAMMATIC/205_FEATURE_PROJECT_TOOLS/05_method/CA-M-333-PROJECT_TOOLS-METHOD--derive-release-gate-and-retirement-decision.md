# Summary

Derive the Release Version gate and retirement decision

## Scope

Construction of the exact promotion, rollback, and old-image-retirement predicates.

## Claim

The Tool derives promotion only from matching sealed candidate evidence in the required order: compilation, declared full suite, separately retained complete runtime package, no-hook Skill delivery, and actual candidate image; it derives old-image retirement only from the exact verified prior image identity and unused/rollback-free evidence.

## Details

Missing, stale, partial, mismatched, or recording-uncertain evidence yields a blocked or pending decision. This construction neither changes a selection nor removes an image.
