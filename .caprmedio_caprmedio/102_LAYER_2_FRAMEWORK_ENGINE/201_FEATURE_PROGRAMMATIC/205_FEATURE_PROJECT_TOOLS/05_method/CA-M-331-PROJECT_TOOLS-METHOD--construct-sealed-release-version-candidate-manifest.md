# Summary

Construct one sealed Release Version candidate manifest

## Scope

Pure construction of the N/N+1 candidate inventory before release effects.

## Claim

The Tool constructs one canonical `candidateSnapshotManifest` by normalizing the sealed request into ordered repository-relative input/output rows, binding each row to its digest and destination, and deriving one candidate manifest SHA-256 without copying, installing, compiling, testing, or deleting anything.

## Details

Construction rejects duplicate destinations, traversal, missing required Framework Methodology or Engine rows, mismatched versions, and ambiguous current selections. The result is an input to later admitted effects, not a Workflow or an execution receipt.
