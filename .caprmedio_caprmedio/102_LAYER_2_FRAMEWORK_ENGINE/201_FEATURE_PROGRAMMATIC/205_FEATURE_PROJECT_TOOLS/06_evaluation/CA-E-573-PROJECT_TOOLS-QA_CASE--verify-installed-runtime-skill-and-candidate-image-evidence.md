# Summary

Verify installed runtime, Skill, and candidate-image evidence

## Scope

Post-suite-gate evidence for a separately retained complete derived runtime, project-local `ca` Skill without hooks, and actual candidate image before public promotion.

## Claim

After CA-E-572 passes, the QA case **must** prove exact separately installed N+1 package and runtime Methodology bytes against the sealed manifest, one staged reviewed project-local `ca` Skill copy without host-hook change, and execution of the actual candidate image by immutable image identity; active runtime selection and public Skill remain N until every promotion gate passes. File presence, image build success, or an Engine-only install is insufficient.

## Details

The case separately records unsupported client target, unavailable image runtime, or missing full Framework installer surface as blockers. It does not infer a successful installation from a dry run.
