# Summary

Verify release failure, rollback, and safe image retirement

## Scope

Failure after candidate effects, recording uncertainty, and eventual exact old-image retirement.

## Claim

The QA case **must** inject bounded install, Skill, test, image, and result-recording failures and prove preservation or restoration of N, source/settings/Journal bytes, and truthful shared Run/Action evidence; it **must** prove that only the exact verified unused old image is removed after all promotion gates pass.

## Details

Assert no effect replay after uncertain recording, no broad prune, and no removal while a container or rollback reference retains the old image. A blocked recovery remains blocked rather than being reported complete.

Add the source-copy predecessor cases. After a completed normal copy at the fixed target `101_LAYER_1_FRAMEWORK_METHODOLOGY/sources`, inject a later compiler, suite, image, recording, or promotion failure and allow the candidate to remain unpromoted. Reopen the predecessor proof and require the old frozen manifest SHA-256, expected and actual old copy SHA-256, same executing N, complete old-tree source paths with byte SHA-256 and modes, exact old-tree currentness before and after the check, and authenticated canonical Journal plus Action/Run and sealed CA-D-574 checkpoint/proof references. Presence of arbitrary old JSON, an unknown/tampered/unrecorded/unsafe proof, wrong N or identity, mode drift, or any old-tree mutation must return blocked and retain N. Separately verify that the new candidate seals and revalidates its own current source/settings/frontier/authority, performs a fresh normal copy, and requires new actual equals new expected; old and new source/frontier/settings digests need not match. No predecessor proof may authorize a new candidate, reuse output, or replay an old effect. These checks add no public request, schema, CLI, route, or graph member.

Add one current-admission case using the evidence worker's exact N10 registration payload when supplied. It must be a source-authoritative `schema_version: 1` carrier with exactly one record whose `basis` is `current admission of historical delivery evidence` and whose keys are exactly the CA-D-567 set. The test must re-read every pinned Journal, Action/Run, checkpoint, candidate manifest, executing-N identity, fixed source-copy root, expected/actual copy digest, and persistent inventory, and require exactly one current authoritative match using CA-D-567's complete mode-aware persistent-inventory verifier. This current admission must not be reported as retroactive sealing or proof of historical byte immutability. Tamper the registration, any referenced bytes, current N, source root, inventory, or a no-effect boundary and require fail-closed refusal, N retention, and no copy/replace/reuse/replay/promotion. It may only retain or replace the exact occupied predecessor copy during a fresh independently sealed delivery; malformed, unknown, duplicate, ambiguous, tampered, wrong-N, unsafe, or inventory-mismatched records must remain blocked.
