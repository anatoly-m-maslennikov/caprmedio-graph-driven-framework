# Summary

Validate public-release request admission

## Scope

one public-release request before execution.

## Claim

**the Operator** **must** verify that missing fields, unknown fields, bad digests, unsafe refs, malformed Run graph, stale preview, and absent or stale authorization all stop before a native binding is invoked.

## Details

Use a disposable Project and mock bindings. A valid preview alone is not execute success.
