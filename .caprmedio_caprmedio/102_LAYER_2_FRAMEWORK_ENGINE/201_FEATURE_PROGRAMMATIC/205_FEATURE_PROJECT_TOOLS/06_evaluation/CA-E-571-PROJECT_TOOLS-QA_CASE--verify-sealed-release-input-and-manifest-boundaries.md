# Summary

Verify sealed Release Version input and manifest boundaries

## Scope

Candidate-manifest construction and rejection before any effect.

## Claim

The QA case **must** prove that one complete sealed N/N+1 request produces a deterministic manifest and that changed source, settings, frontier, destination, digest, duplicate row, traversal, or caller-supplied substitute is rejected without source, runtime, Skill, image, or Journal mutation.

## Details

Assert that the manifest includes Framework Methodology and required Engine entries rather than accepting an Engine-Tools-only candidate. This is construction proof, not release success evidence.
