# Summary

Evaluate declared behavior and canonical ownership

## Scope

New or changed PROGRAMMATIC Requirements, Delivery records and their implementation in modules, units, adapters, Tools, Apps, MCP and workflows.

## Claim

Accept implementation only when each applicable declared Requirement and Delivery obligation has an identifiable canonical implementation owner, without silently adding business policy. Prefer fewer coherent units and modules, but do not impose an artificial one-to-one cardinality. Shared behavior may be many-to-many when semantic ownership remains unambiguous.

## Details

- Map each applicable Requirement or Delivery obligation to the actual module or unit that owns its behavior; a relation or projection is not proof.
- Exercise representative callers and adapters to verify delegation to the canonical owner rather than divergent reimplementation.
- Reject invented policy, approval, lifecycle or validation behavior not declared by active authority.
- Accept cohesive helpers and shared adapters when they preserve one semantic owner; reject duplicate decisions, unexplained sprawl or boundary leakage.
- Record deliberate splits or cross-unit relations with their reason and evidence; locality is a preference, not a hard file-count rule.
