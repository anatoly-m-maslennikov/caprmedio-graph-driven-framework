# Reject a hidden effect in changed source

## Claim checked

One changed effect function declares its complete effect boundary or allocates
persistent ownership to an object.

## Test case

Evaluate one changed function that reads the process environment implicitly
before writing its declared target.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the function is rejected until the environment observation is
an explicit input or an owned adapter boundary.

## Failure disposition

Block the changed unit until the hidden observation is removed.
