# Require an object for a persistent effect owner

## Claim checked

One effect that owns identity, state, an invariant, a resource, a lifecycle, or
a replaceable adapter across calls is applied through a specifically named
object method.

## Test case

Evaluate one standalone function that acquires a resource and retains its
lifecycle state for a later call.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the function is rejected and the persistent responsibility is
allocated to one object with explicit acquisition, use, and release boundaries.

## Failure disposition

Reject the effect boundary until its persistent owner is explicit.
