# Run an installed Tool without uv

## Claim checked

One installed CAPRMEDIO Tool executes from `.caprmedio_install` without uv, a
project virtual environment, or another dependency outside the installation.

## Test case

Invoke one installed Tool in a clean process where uv and the project virtual
environment are unavailable.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when the Tool reaches its declared entry boundary using solely its
installed carrier and admitted host prerequisites.

## Failure disposition

Reject the installed-runtime claim until the external workflow dependency is
removed.
