# Verify deterministic transformation from declared inputs

## Claim checked

One declared deterministic PROGRAMMATIC transformation produces its result and
failure values from explicit declared inputs without an implicit host
observation or external effect.

## Applicable conditions

Apply when a component parses, classifies, validates, plans, projects,
formats, or otherwise transforms explicit input into a result.

## Test case

Evaluate one transformation twice with the same declared input while varying
an otherwise irrelevant host observation.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when both results and failure values are equivalent and the
transformation reports no filesystem, process, clock, environment, network,
persistence, or logging-export effect.

## Failure disposition

Stop treating the unit as deterministic and assign its missing observation or
effect boundary to the appropriate owner.
