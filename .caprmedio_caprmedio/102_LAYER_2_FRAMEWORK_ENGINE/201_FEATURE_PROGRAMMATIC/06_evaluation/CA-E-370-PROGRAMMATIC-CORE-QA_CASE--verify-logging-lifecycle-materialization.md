# Verify logging lifecycle materialization

## Claim checked

One production-relevant PROGRAMMATIC component materializes the active Logging
Policy's sink, retention, access, sampling, rotation, size, back-pressure,
unavailable-sink, and disk-pressure boundaries.

## Test case

Evaluate one production-relevant component whose logging materialization omits
its unavailable-sink behavior.

## Acceptance criteria

Pass only when deployment is rejected until the missing behavior is declared
without configuration, Implementation, or Delivery claiming policy authority.

## Failure disposition

Block the production logging path until its lifecycle materialization is
complete.
