# Summary

Bound and recover canary exposure

## Scope

Canary Evaluation of a changed PROGRAMMATIC component against a production-like or live workload.

## Claim

Canary Evaluation **may** be admitted **only when** the cohort **or** shadow surface isolates exposure; exposure is bounded; immediate stop is available; **and** rollback has been tested against the applicable state boundary. Canary evidence supplements rather than replaces required pre-deployment evidence.

## Details

These are necessary safety conditions, not a complete canary technique specification.
