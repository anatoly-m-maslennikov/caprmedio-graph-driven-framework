# Validate Source-Backed Subject Retrieval

the Applicable Methodology Retrieval Tool Validation **must not pass** if (a Subject query matches a non-governing Carrier **or** a Process query matches a non-occurrent governed Subject Path **or** a prerequisite governor is omitted **or** compilation order changes **or** an unresolved prerequisite passes silently **or** a projected Carrier differs from its Source Carrier after Projection metadata removal **or** the same frontier and query produce different results **or** retrieval writes a persistent Subject Index Carrier, cache, Source Carrier, or generated methodology Carrier).
