# Verify read selected caprmedio atom carriers

## Claim checked

CA-M-184 realizes the current direct contract of CA-R-864 without unowned behavior.

## Test case

In one controlled fixture, execute the Method at its declared boundary with valid input and one contract-relevant invalid or stale precondition.

## Acceptance criteria

The valid path produces only the declared outcome for CA-R-864, and the invalid or stale path fails explicitly without an unauthorized mutation, widened scope, or invented provenance.

## Failure disposition

Reject the realization, preserve the observed discrepancy, and return the boundary to its named owner for correction.
