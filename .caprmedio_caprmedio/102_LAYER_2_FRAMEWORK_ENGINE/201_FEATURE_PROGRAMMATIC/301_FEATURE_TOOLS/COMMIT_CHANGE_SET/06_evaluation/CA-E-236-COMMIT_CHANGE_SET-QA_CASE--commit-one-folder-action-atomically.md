# Commit one folder action atomically

Given one sealed folder action with its complete ordered entry set, when `COMMIT_CHANGE_SET` applies it, then exactly one real-change commit contains all and only that folder action's entry changes with its Initiative-based message. Its Journal record is appended independently and a later Journal-only batch, if any, contains only Journal carrier changes.
