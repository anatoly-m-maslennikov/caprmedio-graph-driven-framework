# Register the four generic Tool units

## Applicable when

Apply when realizing the current acceptance boundary of CA-R-1153, CA-R-1154, CA-R-1155, CA-R-1156.

## Procedure

1. Resolve the current governed contract, target boundary, and allowed direct dependencies for the listed Requirement set.
2. Apply the one shared procedure expressed by this Method without widening any listed Requirement into another Tool, Scope Unit, lifecycle, or authority boundary.
3. Preserve explicit success, rejection, blocked, and recovery outcomes required by the current contract.

## Outcome

The listed Requirements have one direct, independently replaceable realization procedure with no duplicate acceptance owner.

## Failure or stop

Stop and return an explicit failure when the selected contract, boundary, or required precondition is absent, ambiguous, stale, or invalid.
