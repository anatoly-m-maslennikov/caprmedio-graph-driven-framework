# Project bounded Work Journal NDJSON to TOON

## Applicable when

Use this Method when a bounded Work Journal frontier must be represented as a compact TOON Projection.

## Procedure

1. Resolve an exact Journal file, event range, or sealed event frontier and record its ordered source identities and digests.
2. Parse every NDJSON line strictly and reject malformed, duplicate, or changed input before projection.
3. Encode the same ordered event values into TOON without adding authority, interpretation, or omitted fields.
4. Attach the source frontier, encoder identity and version, output digest, and generation time to the Projection metadata.
5. Decode or independently compare the result to prove lossless identity, value, and order preservation.

## Outcome

One reproducible non-authoritative TOON Projection represents the exact bounded Journal frontier losslessly.

## Failure or stop

Produce no Projection when the frontier changes during generation, any line is malformed, or the result cannot be proven lossless.
