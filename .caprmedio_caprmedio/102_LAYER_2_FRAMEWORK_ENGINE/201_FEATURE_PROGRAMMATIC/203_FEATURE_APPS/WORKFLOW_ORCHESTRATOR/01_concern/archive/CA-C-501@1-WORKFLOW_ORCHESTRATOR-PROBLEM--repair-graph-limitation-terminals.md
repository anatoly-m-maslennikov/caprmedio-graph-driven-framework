# Summary

Repair graph limitation terminals

## Concern

graph-build native stale, incomplete and conflicting outcomes can escape the selected graph transition table or imply a completed Action.

## Evidences

the final source-to-code review confirmed this bounded discrepancy. independent adjudication separated it from unsupported status-transition and authorization-model proposals. focused fixture results establish repair behavior, not actual release completion.

## Blast radius

the affected selected capability and its current release candidate. installed N, historical Events and frozen test snapshots remain preserved.

## Decision

map native limitations to interrupted pending terminal results, retain native evidence and verify both graph routes with real recorder fixtures.

## Result

both graph routes pass the three limitation outcomes: one regression with six subcases. the independent review accepts the truthful interrupted-pending terminal mapping and retained native evidence. this resolves the bounded code discrepancy; it is not evidence of actual release promotion.
