# Summary

provide isolated host execution for Release Runs

## Scope

the host execution capability for source-admitted Release Version Runs in WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR.

## Claim

WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR **must** provide a Release-only Host Executor that can run the admitted host-dependent gates while preserving the separate native **and** Docker execution boundaries.

## Details

- the capability uses the existing source-bound Release implementation, exact Operator authorization **and** canonical Journal recording.
- **only** a fresh admitted Release Run **or** an expressly authorized recovery of a Run already bound **to** this Host Executor can execute through it.
- worker startup remains explicit. startup creates no Run; it consumes no work from another executor's Queue.
- the ordinary Docker worker retains its existing isolation, with no host Docker socket added.
- an unavailable Host Executor blocks Release admission; another executor does **not** become an implicit fallback.
- this capability does **not** authorize promotion, image deletion **or** replay of an uncertain effect. those effects retain their existing gates.
