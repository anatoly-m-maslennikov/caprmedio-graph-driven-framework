# Summary

Execute Actions through a replaceable Codex adapter

## Scope

WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATOR's initial local execution capability.

## Claim

implement Agentic execution through a replaceable Codex CLI adapter with structured output admission.

## Details

1. invoke codex exec with argument arrays, stdin prompts, a JSON output schema **and** an explicit isolated working directory. native execution uses a read-only CLI sandbox; the dedicated Docker Agent service uses its container boundary **without** Project mounts. use existing authentication through runtime credential admission, never through an image layer.
2. give the Agent the selected Atom, current rules, the Action prompt **and** phase report, with no other Atom reports.
3. require a structured report plus optional proposed replacement content. validate identity, source hashes, confidence **and** saved check evidence before admission.
4. retain reports **and** candidate content under the dispatch identity before applying changes.
5. bound subprocess duration **and** output reads. timeouts, invalid output **or** missing credentials block execution rather than inventing a pass.
6. keep the executor interface independent of Codex so other harnesses can be added later.
