# Summary

Verify implementation prompt context and handoff boundaries

## Scope

Integrated and Isolated prompt invocation and return behavior.

## Claim

the Implementation passes this Evaluation only when each actual Agentic dispatch uses its supplied Step context, and an Isolated dispatch has a complete under-fifteen-minute subtask handoff and fresh admission.

## Details

Missing context blocks. The returned result cannot auto-dispatch a successor, alter Workflow state, or claim that the caller accepted its handoff.
