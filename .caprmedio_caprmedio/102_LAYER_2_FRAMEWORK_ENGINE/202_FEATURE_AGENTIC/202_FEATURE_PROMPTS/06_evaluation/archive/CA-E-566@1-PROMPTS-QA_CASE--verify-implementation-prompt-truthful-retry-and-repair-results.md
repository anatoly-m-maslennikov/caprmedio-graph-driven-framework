# Summary

Verify implementation prompt truthful retry and repair results

## Scope

diagnosis, retry admission, repair, and renewed checking prompts.

## Claim

the Implementation passes this Evaluation only when it preserves initial failure evidence, counts retries truthfully, blocks unadmitted repair, and never labels repaired or unperformed work as passed.

## Details

Method learning is excluded from this Implementation Workflow case and remains separately initiated under CA-O-102.
