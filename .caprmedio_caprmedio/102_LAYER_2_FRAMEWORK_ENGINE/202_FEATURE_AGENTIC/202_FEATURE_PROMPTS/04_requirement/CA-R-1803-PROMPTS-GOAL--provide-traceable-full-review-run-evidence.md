# Summary

Provide traceable full review Run evidence

## Scope

evidence produced by the prompt Implementation for an Operator-authorized RMED Atoms Base Revise Run.

## Claim

the Implementation **must** provide a full traceable Run record through its Markdown report **and** correlated shared Project Journal Records, including partial, blocked, **and** empty Runs.

## Details

- the full report retains the requested **and** selected scope, source **and** rule bindings, **all** per-Atom check evidence, findings, correction dispositions, pending work, blockers, **and** actual outcome.
- the Journal records actual execution Events with the same Run ID **and** report reference. the report presents the saved review evidence; it does **not** establish another Journal **or** independently authored source of Events.
- evidence-recording failures remain explicit alongside saved work. successful checks **or** fixes do **not** prove that a report write **or** Journal append succeeded.
- the required operations belong **to** CA-O-104-CORE_META_MODEL-WORKFLOW--review-and-repair-a-bounded-rmed-atom-batch; this Requirement specifies their observable evidence result, **not** another Workflow.
