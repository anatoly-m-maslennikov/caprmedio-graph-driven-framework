# Summary

Run the candidate image canary

## Step

This Step invokes CA-O-168 once with phase `candidate_image_canary`, binding CA-O-176's exact immutable candidate image digest and staged complete package, Methodology and hook-free Skill.

## Details

This is the frozen-container canary only; it is not host Candidate E2E or Full Gate aggregation. Its result must prove the bound candidate image and staged complete package, not only source files, a manifest or build success. It cannot select N+1, remove images, use an unbound external/paid CLI or retry. Missing or unsafe proof stops before CA-O-182.
