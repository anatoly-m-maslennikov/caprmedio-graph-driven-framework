# Preserve the Tool-MCP-Skill authority chain

the FPF Extension **must** realize deterministic behavior first **in** canonical project-local Tools, expose admitted Tool contracts through the project-local provider-neutral MCP service **without** changing their meaning, **and** make the `fpf` Skill a thin direct consumer of that MCP surface; the Skill **must not** duplicate Tool mechanics, MCP transport, lifecycle control, **or** a `ca` routing wrapper, **and** Consumer-owned Demands **must not** be admitted **before** they target **`=1`** identified current MCP Implementation result.
