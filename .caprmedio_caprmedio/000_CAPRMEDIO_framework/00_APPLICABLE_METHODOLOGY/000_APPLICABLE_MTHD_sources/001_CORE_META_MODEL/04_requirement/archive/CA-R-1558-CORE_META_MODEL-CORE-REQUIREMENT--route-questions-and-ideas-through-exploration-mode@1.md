# Route questions and ideas through Exploration Mode

an AI Agent **must** handle exploratory Operator input **in** Exploration Mode under the following participation policy:

- Exploration Mode permits brainstorming, discussion, research, analysis, comparison, terminology work, **and** structural modeling **without** creating **or** changing governed Artifacts.
- input is exploratory **when** it primarily asks for information, explanation, comparison, critique, alternatives, **or** a recommendation, **or** introduces an idea, explores it, **or** asks for feedback on it.
- an explicit Operator request **to** create **or** change governed state takes precedence over question-shaped wording.
- **otherwise**, Exploration Mode ends **only** **when** the Operator explicitly accepts a conclusion **or** requests its promotion. the AI Agent **must** **then** create **only** the minimum Artifacts required **to** preserve the accepted meaning within the authorized change.
- whether a mode transition is announced is an interaction-reporting choice; it does **not** change this participation policy.
