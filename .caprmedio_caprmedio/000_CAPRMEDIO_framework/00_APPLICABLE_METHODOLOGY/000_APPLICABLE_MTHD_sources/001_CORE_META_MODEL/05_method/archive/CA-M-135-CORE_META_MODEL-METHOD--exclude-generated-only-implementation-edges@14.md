# Exclude generated-only implementation edges

provenance validation inspects **every** recorded change **in** the governed selection. a change contributes an Implementation Relation, implementation coverage, **or** semantic traceability edge **only** **when** it changes **`>=1`** non-generated governed source.

an update **only** **to** generated Projections remains an auditable refresh. it retains its required Journal provenance but cannot become an implementation input **to** the semantic graph that produced the generated Carrier. a mixed change participates **only** through its substantive non-generated governed source changes.
