# Summary

Define General Artifact Graph

## Scope

the General Artifact Graph and its represented governed Artifacts and Structural Entities.

## Claim

a General Artifact Graph **means** the derived CAPRMEDIO Graph that represents governed Artifacts **and** Structural Entities as nodes, locates them by their authoritative Carriers, **and** connects them through the existing direct containment relations. its Structural Entity nodes include Scope Units **and** Atom Collections; its Artifact nodes include Atoms, Journals, **and** Projections.

node identities, Carrier locations, **and** containment come from existing authoritative sources **and** registered containment rules, **not** independently maintained graph declarations. an administrative directory does **not** become a Structural Entity merely because it is a folder. the graph provides their shared structural context **without** duplicating specialized graphs **or** becoming a separate source of authority.

## Details
