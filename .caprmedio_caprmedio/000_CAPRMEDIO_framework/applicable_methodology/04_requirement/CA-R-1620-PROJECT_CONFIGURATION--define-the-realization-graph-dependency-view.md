# Summary

Define the Realization Graph dependency view

## Scope

optional dependency views of Realization Graphs.

## Claim

the dependency view of a Realization Graph **means** an optional derived view of the selected declarations, resources, internal dependency targets, external dependency targets, **and** admitted typed Relations among them.

## Details

- its specification identifies the selected population, Relation Types, source boundary, **and** limits of dependency traversal; recursive reachability does **not** establish complete coverage by itself.
- the view **must** derive from the same source-backed graph facts **without** another independently maintained dependency authority. cycles are represented **when** evidenced; their validity is checked against applicable Claims rather than assumed from the view name.
- this view does **not** require a second universal view.
