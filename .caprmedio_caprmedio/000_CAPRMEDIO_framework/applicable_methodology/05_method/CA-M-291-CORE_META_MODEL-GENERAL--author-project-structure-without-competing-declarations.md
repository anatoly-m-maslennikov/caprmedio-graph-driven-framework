# Summary

Author Project Structure **without** competing declarations

## Scope

Project Structure declarations.

## Claim

**to** express Project Structure, use one declaration for **every** non-root Scope Unit, reference its parent by the reserved Project-root reference **or** the parent's unique Name, **and** keep structural Local Order distinct from Navigational Order Number. retain an explicit Label independently of Ordered/Unordered Type. retain readable Structural Level **and** authority path **only** with their checked derivation from declared parentage **and** applicable Carrier conventions; physical nesting **must not** silently replace logical parentage. use concrete Carrier bindings as declared values rather than repeating them **in** Goal, Requirement, **or** Delivery Atoms. write an Authority Mode override **only** **when** explicitly selected for that unit; an omitted override remains inherited rather than copied as an explicit value. references **and** observations **must** distinguish the declared unit from its existing Carrier **and** Goal coverage.
