# Summary

Check the Journal storage boundary

## Scope

Journal admission checks event **and** storage integrity **without** becoming a Project-conformance gate.

## Claim

report a failed Evaluation **if** the Journal loses recordable evidence because of Project defects, accepts corrupted **or** unauthorized writes, silently changes observations, **or** rewrites accepted history.

## Details

### Cases

1. submit a correctly encoded event describing a conforming Project change.
2. keep that event envelope valid while recording a legacy Atom ID, broken filename, invalid placement, malformed Atom Properties, unresolved Relation, **or** invalid lifecycle transition.
3. change the live Project **after** capture while leaving the sealed historical observation intact.
4. submit unreadable event data, missing required Event identity **or** fields, a digest mismatch, unauthorized append access, **or** an attempt **to** rewrite accepted history.
5. resubmit the same Event identity **and** payload; **then** supply a conflicting payload under that identity.
6. record an action whose separate conformance Evaluation failed **or** remained unresolved.

### Acceptance

- cases 1, 2, 3, **and** 6 remain recordable **without** inventing identities, repairing observed values, **or** claiming a successful conformance verdict.
- case 4 fails storage admission, preserves pending evidence safely, **and** leaves accepted history unchanged.
- an identical retry creates no duplicate record. an identity collision with different payload fails **without** overwriting history.
- conformance Evaluations remain independently available; their verdicts do **not** become prerequisites for recording the facts they evaluate.
- Journal acceptance grants no Project-mutation permission **and** does **not** bypass a separate action's preconditions.
