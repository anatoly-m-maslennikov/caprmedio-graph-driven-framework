# Summary

Prepare structural change

## Operation

Prepare Structural Change **means** the Action that produces one bounded change proposal against the exact current Project Structure state. the proposal identifies the requested creation, rename, reparenting, reorder, path rebinding, removal, **or** reconciliation; its expected declarations; affected references, Goals, descendants **and** Carriers; required source changes; validation conditions; **and** a recoverable cutover boundary. a rename **or** reparenting **must** account for incoming references **and** parent-owned Goals, rather than leaving them attached **to** a different unit. declaration removal **must not** imply Carrier deletion. an undeclared folder, missing folder, **or** missing Active Goal is an observation requiring an explicit disposition, **not** permission **to** invent, erase, **or** accept authority.
