# Summary

Assess update identity for Atom lifecycle

## Operation

This Step invokes exactly existing CA-O-067, assess Atom update identity, as one Agentic invocation in Integrated context under R1527. It is read-only and supplies no effect permission.

### Input and parameter binding

Bind exactly one existing target Revision, its complete Carrier/proposed Claim/properties/Summary, applicable change authority and assessment evidence from the admitted Update request. An ambiguous or multi-target Update request returns invalid before invoking O067; never reuse one target's result for another target. On an authorized O129 reassessment route use the explicitly admitted fresh proposal/current target/evidence retained in that result and its revalidation decision, not silently substituted values. Bind O067's exact current definition and this Step/Workflow Run references before dispatch; changed definitions pause for R1525 revalidation.

Return O067's identity-preserving, replacement-required or unresolved assessment with its exact target/proposal/source binding unchanged. The Workflow, not O067 or this Step, maps it to update effects, terminal Replace handoff or blocked evidence/Operator decision.

## Details

This direct O067 binding satisfies M303 without a nested classifier or multi-Action Step. Stale results are not approval. Retain the actual Step/Action Run and parent identity, current context and canonical Journal evidence, including read-only/no-op/failure outcomes; no mutation or successor invocation occurs here.
