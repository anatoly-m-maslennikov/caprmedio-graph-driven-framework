# Summary

Resolve and activate Operator priorities

## Operation

Resolve Operator Priorities **means** the Action that turns applicable Operator input into the effective priority model for an identified Scope **and** Project stage.

### execution

1. identify the affected Scope **and** Project stage from the Operator input **and** its applicable context.
2. resolve the Operator-selected model, effective parameters, active criteria, applicable authority, **and** non-negotiable constraints. retain **every** applicable criterion **without** imposing a fixed catalog **or** comparison by priority order on another model.
3. check whether the input determines an admissible model **and** the parameters needed **to** apply it.
4. **if** that resolution succeeds, activate the resolved priorities **in** the CAPRMEDIO Framework Instance for the identified context **and** return them as the Action result.

### unresolved input

**if** the selected model, required parameters, authority, **or** context remains unresolved:

- present the known input **and** the exact unresolved point **to** the Operator.
- do **not** invent a model, infer a missing preference, **or** activate an unresolved change.
- report the Action as unresolved, **not** successfully completed.
