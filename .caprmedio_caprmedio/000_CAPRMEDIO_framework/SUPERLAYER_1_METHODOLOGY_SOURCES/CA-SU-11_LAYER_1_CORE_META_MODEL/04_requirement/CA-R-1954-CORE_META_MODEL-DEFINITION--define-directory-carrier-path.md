## Summary

Define Directory Carrier.Path

## Claim scope

Directory Carrier filesystem locators.

## Claim

A Directory Carrier's Path **means** the locator of its directory within a filesystem, absolute or relative to a stated base. It does **not** define Scope Unit parentage or Carrier identity.

### Formal claim

```text
Directory.Path[string]{1}
```

## Details

CA-D-445 separates physical layout from declared hierarchy; CA-R-1660 says physical containment must not silently replace logical parentage. The Operator distinguishes Carrier ID from path.

Active CA-R-2515 currently assigns Carrier definitions and classification to Delivery. That conflict remains for the later content migration; this draft does not change or supersede active rules.
