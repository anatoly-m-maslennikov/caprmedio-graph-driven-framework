"""Resolve Concern, Analysis, Plan, Implementation, and Ops Atom lifecycles.

Usage:
    python3 FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/TOOLS/migrations/resolve_cap_io_atom_lifecycles.py
    python3 FRAMEWORK_ENGINE/TOOLS/migrations/resolve_cap_io_atom_lifecycles.py --apply

The default mode is read-only. The migration adds role-specific META and GOV
authority, updates affected active authority, moves the resolved Question to
solved, and moves completed Analysis Atoms to done.
