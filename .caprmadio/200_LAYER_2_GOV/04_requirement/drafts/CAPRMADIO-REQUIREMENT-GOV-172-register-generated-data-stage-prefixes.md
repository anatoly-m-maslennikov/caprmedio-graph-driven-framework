# Register generated-data stage prefixes

GOV must register this ordered vocabulary for generated-data pipeline stages:

| Prefix | Stage meaning |
|---|---|
| `src` | Canonical NDJSON Journal input; authority comes from the Journal, not the prefix. |
| `stg` | Deterministic, lossless TOON projection of a bounded `src` frontier. |
| `mrt` | Consumer-ready semantic Projection, including Requirement groupings by scope and tier or Mermaid relation maps. |
| `biz` | Aggregated CAPRMADIO artifact and implementation metrics, including point-in-time snapshots and historical trends. |

Dependencies must move forward through `src → stg → mrt → biz`; a stage may depend on any earlier registered stage but must not depend on a later stage. These prefixes classify Journal inputs and generated Projections only. Unregistered stage prefixes remain available for later governed extension.
