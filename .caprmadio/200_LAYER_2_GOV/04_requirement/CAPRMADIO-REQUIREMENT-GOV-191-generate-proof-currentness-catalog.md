# Generate the proof currentness Catalog

CAPRMADIO generates a non-authoritative proof-currentness Catalog from governed proof dependency frontiers and their additional invalidation conditions. The Catalog reports each proof as `current`, `stale`, or `unknown`, marks only the smallest direct and transitive dependency closure affected by a change, never infers currentness from timestamps alone, and never mutates the historical proof record.
