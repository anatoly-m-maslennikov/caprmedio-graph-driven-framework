# Synchronize installed methodology only on command

CAPRMADIO maintainers edit the reusable methodology only in its repository-root
source. An ordinary source edit never rewrites
`.caprmadio/000_caprmadio_framework/` and no workflow copies installed files back into
the root source.

An explicit operator synchronization command performs the one-way
root-to-installed refresh. Until that command runs, the installed methodology
remains the last accepted snapshot and may intentionally differ from the
working source.

## Rationale

Separating authoring from installation keeps ordinary edits bounded, preserves a reviewable installed snapshot, and prevents accidental bidirectional drift.
