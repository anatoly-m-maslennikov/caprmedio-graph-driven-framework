# Keep current Layer dependencies acyclic

The ordered layer graph is a directed acyclic graph:

- structural authority and refinement follow the cumulative topology defined
  by CAPRMADIO-REQUIREMENT-065;
- a later layer may consume authority from its own or any earlier layer;
- no layer may govern or redefine an earlier layer;
- dependency is distinct from scope specialization and `child_of`; and
- peer scopes interact through explicit Contracts rather than layer precedence.

A project Principle may directly parent a Core Requirement in any Layer. That
applicability edge neither creates a Layer dependency nor requires intermediate
Layers to restate the Principle.

An Ops fact from a later layer may become input to Exploration Mode. After explicit acceptance, the result enters the normal forward flow at its proper owning layer. This feedback is not a backward authority edge.

If backward coupling cannot be deleted, re-homed, or expressed as feedback, CAPRMADIO proposes remodeling the coupled owners as horizontal Features. The operator must accept that structural change.
