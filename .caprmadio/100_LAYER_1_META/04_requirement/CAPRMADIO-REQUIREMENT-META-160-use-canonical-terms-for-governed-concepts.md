# Use canonical terms for governed concepts

Whenever a governed Atom invokes a CAPRMADIO-specific concept, it uses that
concept's exact canonical term. An alias, synonym, paraphrase, partial
definition, example, or neighboring concept must not substitute for the
canonical term.

Explanatory text may follow the canonical term but cannot replace or redefine
it. After the canonical term has been introduced, unambiguous pronouns and
grammatical references may refer to it without repeating the term.

When no existing canonical term fits the intended meaning, the author must
clarify or extend the governed vocabulary before admitting the Claim rather
than silently inventing another name.
