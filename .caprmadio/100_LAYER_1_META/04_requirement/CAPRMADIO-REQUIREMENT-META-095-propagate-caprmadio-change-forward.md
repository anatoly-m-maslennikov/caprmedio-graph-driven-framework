# Propagate CAPRMADIO change forward

An accepted upstream change propagates only forward through the ordered layer graph. It:

1. identifies affected downstream Projections, Methods, Assurance criteria, Delivery rules, Implementations, and Ops consumers;
2. marks each affected downstream artifact potentially stale without mutating historical atoms;
3. routes required reconciliation to the artifact's owning layer; and
4. closes only when every affected currentness or assurance gate reaches its required disposition.

Refreshing a Projection alone does not complete propagation. Downstream Method, Assurance, Delivery, Implementation, and Ops remain independently accountable. Feedback from a later layer may create a new upstream Concern, but cannot rewrite upstream authority or introduce a backward dependency.
