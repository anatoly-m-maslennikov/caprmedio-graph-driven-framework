# Requirement — Keep Requirements realization-agnostic

Every Requirement states an outcome, obligation, or externally observable
boundary that the governed product or project must, may, or must not satisfy
without prescribing its internal code or code organization.

A normative choice about programming languages, libraries, algorithms,
functions, classes, modules, source-file structure, or another construction
technique is Method. A normative choice about packaging, release, deployment,
distribution, installation, migration, upgrade, or rollback is Delivery. The
concrete code, configuration, schema realization, executable automation, or
other operative asset is Implementation.

A Requirement may preserve an accepted external interface, protocol, data
shape, or host obligation when conformance to that boundary is itself required.
It does not thereby prescribe the project's internal realization. A candidate
that combines an independently replaceable outcome with a code-facing Method or
Delivery rule must be split before admission.

## Primary claim

Requirements are realization-agnostic; code-facing construction rules belong
to Method, delivery-path rules belong to Delivery, and operative code and
configuration belong to Implementation.
