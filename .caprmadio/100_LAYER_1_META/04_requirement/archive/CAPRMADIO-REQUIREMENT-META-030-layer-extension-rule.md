# Govern Layer extensions

A candidate layer must declare:

- one responsibility not already owned by another layer;
- its predecessor and successor;
- accepted inputs and produced outputs;
- entry, exit, and failure behavior;
- its dependency direction; and
- why a Feature or ordinary scope cannot own the concern.

The candidate is admissible only when the resulting graph remains acyclic and
existing responsibilities remain non-overlapping. Otherwise, model it as a Feature or another governed scope rather than adding a Layer.
