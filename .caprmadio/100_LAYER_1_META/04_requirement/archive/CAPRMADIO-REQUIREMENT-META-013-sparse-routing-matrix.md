# Requirement — Sparse routing matrix

Internal governance is mandatory. External and relation governance are enabled
independently. Enabling a locus does not require filling every route.

## Primary claim

The routing matrix is sparse: an occupied route has zero or one registered name at each enabled governance locus, and empty routes require no placeholder artifacts.

## Rationale

Sparse interface vocabulary avoids ontology and artifact proliferation while preserving precise routing.
