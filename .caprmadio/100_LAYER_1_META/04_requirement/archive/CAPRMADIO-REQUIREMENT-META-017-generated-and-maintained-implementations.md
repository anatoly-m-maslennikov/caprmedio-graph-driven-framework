# Requirement — Generated and maintained Implementations

A generated current projection declares its generator and source provenance.
A Merge Commit is an atomic relational Implementation with explicit parents.

## Primary claim

Generated reproducible current projections are evergreen Implementations, hand-maintained executable truth is maintained Implementation, and Commits are separate atomic Implementations.

## Rationale

Generator output, maintained source, and commit history have different revision semantics and must not collapse into one artifact identity.
