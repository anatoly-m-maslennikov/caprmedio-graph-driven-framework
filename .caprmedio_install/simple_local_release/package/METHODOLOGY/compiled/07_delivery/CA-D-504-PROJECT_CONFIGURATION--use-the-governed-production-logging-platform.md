# Summary

Use the governed production logging platform

## Scope

production technical and business runtime log Journal Carriers.

## Claim

production technical **and** business runtime log Journals **must** use the deployment environment's governed logging sink. governed CAPRMEDIO workflow **and** local project-control Journals **are not** substitutes for the production system's log platform.

## Details

The configured production-log sink may be a local database, remote database, or another governed logging platform. Runtime logs retain Journal classification and recorded-history authority without being forced into _journal. Workflow and project-control Journals retain their own governed records without replacing that platform or duplicating authority for the same historical fact.
