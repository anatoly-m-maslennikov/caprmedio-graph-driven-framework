# Summary

Keep Atom addresses consistent with carried Properties

## Scope

Atom Properties represented by a filename, matching directory name, or placement.

## Claim

**every** Atom Property represented by a filename, matching directory name, **or** placement **must** agree with its canonical internal value under the applicable Delivery encoding.

- compare resolved values using the registered encoding; a Summary Slug is checked against its Summary serialization, **not** against identical raw text.
- a mismatch is invalid **and** **must** be reported; the address **must not** silently override the value carried inside the Atom.
- agreement checking does **not** authorize rewriting the Atom **or** address. corrections require the applicable authorized change.

## Details
