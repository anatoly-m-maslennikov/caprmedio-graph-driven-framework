# Summary

Keep one source for each relation fact

## Scope

authoritative source declarations for Relation facts.

## Claim

**every** independently authored Relation fact **must** have **`=1`** authoritative source declaration under Single Source of Truth. its representation **in** multiple CAPRMEDIO Graph views remains a reference **or** derived Projection of that declaration **without** creating another independently maintained source.

a Relation derived under admitted derivation authority **must** remain traceable **to** that authority **and** its authoritative input facts, including through upstream Projections. it does **not** require a fabricated direct source declaration for the derived result. this distinction **must not** weaken a Relation Kind's requirement for an explicit source fact **or** permit unsupported inference.

## Details
